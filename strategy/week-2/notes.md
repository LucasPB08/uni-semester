# Week 2: External Analysis (Chapters 2 & 3)

## Key Definitions

**External Environment**
- Forces and factors outside the organization that affect its performance and strategic choices
- Divided into: macro-environment (general) and industry environment (competitive)

**Industry**
- A group of firms producing products/services that are close substitutes for each other
- Serves a similar set of customer needs

**Strategic Group**
- Organizations within an industry following similar strategies or competing on similar bases
- Share similar characteristics (e.g., distribution channels, quality levels, pricing)

**Competitive Advantage**
- Superior performance relative to competitors in the same industry
- Can stem from cost leadership or differentiation

**Market Segments**
- Distinct groups of customers within a market with different needs, characteristics, or behaviors

## Frameworks/Models

### PESTEL Analysis
Framework for analyzing the macro-environment (general external environment).

**Components:**
1. **Political** - Government policies, political stability, tax policy, trade regulations, labor laws
2. **Economic** - Economic growth, interest rates, exchange rates, inflation, unemployment
3. **Social** - Demographics, cultural attitudes, lifestyle changes, education levels, health consciousness
4. **Technological** - R&D activity, automation, technology incentives, rate of technological change
5. **Environmental** - Climate change, environmental regulations, carbon footprint, sustainability concerns
6. **Legal** - Employment law, consumer protection, health & safety, antitrust laws

**Purpose:** Identify opportunities and threats from the broader environment

### Porter's Five Forces
Framework for analyzing industry attractiveness and competitive intensity.

**The Five Forces:**

1. **Threat of New Entrants**
   - Barriers to entry: economies of scale, capital requirements, access to distribution, brand loyalty, government policy, expected retaliation
   - High barriers = Lower threat = More attractive industry

2. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers**
   - Factors: supplier concentration, switching costs, forward integration threat, importance of volume to supplier, differentiation of inputs
   - High supplier power = Less attractive industry

3. **Bargaining Power of Buyers**
   - Factors: buyer concentration, switching costs, backward integration threat, price sensitivity, product differentiation
   - High buyer power = Less attractive industry

4. **Threat of Substitute Products**
   - Products from different industries that satisfy similar customer needs
   - Factors: relative price-performance, switching costs, buyer propensity to substitute
   - High threat = Less attractive industry

5. **Rivalry Among Existing Competitors**
   - Factors: number of competitors, industry growth rate, fixed costs, product differentiation, exit barriers, strategic stakes
   - High rivalry = Less attractive industry

**Overall:** Five Forces determine industry profitability and attractiveness

### Industry Life Cycle
Framework showing how industries evolve through predictable stages.

**Stages:**

1. **Introduction**
   - Characteristics: Low sales, few competitors, high costs, negative profits
   - Strategy focus: Building awareness, establishing market

2. **Growth**
   - Characteristics: Rapidly increasing sales, new entrants, improving profits, product standardization begins
   - Strategy focus: Market penetration, building brand preference

3. **Maturity**
   - Characteristics: Slowing sales growth, market saturation, intense competition, price competition increases
   - Strategy focus: Market segmentation, efficiency, differentiation

4. **Decline**
   - Characteristics: Falling sales, excess capacity, price wars, competitors exit
   - Strategy focus: Cost reduction, niche focus, or harvest/divest

**Strategic implications:** Appropriate strategies vary by life cycle stage

## Key Concepts

### Macro vs. Industry Environment

**Macro-Environment (PESTEL)**
- Broad societal forces affecting all industries
- Less controllable, long-term trends
- Affects multiple industries simultaneously

**Industry Environment (Five Forces)**
- Competitive forces specific to an industry
- More immediate impact on firm strategy
- Determines industry profitability potential

### Scenario Planning
- Technique for analyzing uncertain futures
- Develop multiple plausible scenarios based on key uncertainties
- Prepare strategies that are robust across scenarios
- Useful when PESTEL factors are highly uncertain

### Complementors (6th Force)
- Organizations that provide complementary products/services
- Example: Software developers complement hardware manufacturers
- Can enhance or reduce industry attractiveness

### Strategic Group Analysis
- Map competitors on key strategic dimensions (e.g., price vs. quality, geographic scope vs. product range)
- Identify mobility barriers between groups
- Understand competitive positioning within industry
- Reveals potential strategic moves and competitive gaps

### Drivers of Globalization
- Cost advantages (economies of scale, lower labor costs)
- Market drivers (common customer needs, global customers)
- Competitive drivers (interdependent markets)
- Government drivers (trade liberalization, common standards)

### Hypercompetition
- Environment of rapid competitive moves and short-lived advantages
- Requires continuous innovation and disruption
- Traditional strategic planning less effective
- Need for speed and flexibility in strategy formulation

## Examples

**PESTEL Examples:**
- **Political:** Brexit affecting UK businesses, trade wars between US and China
- **Economic:** 2008 financial crisis, COVID-19 economic impact
- **Social:** Aging populations in developed countries, rise of social media
- **Technological:** AI and machine learning, electric vehicles
- **Environmental:** Carbon emission regulations, renewable energy mandates
- **Legal:** GDPR data protection in EU, antitrust cases against tech giants

**Five Forces Examples:**
- **Low entry barriers:** Online retail, food trucks
- **High supplier power:** Boeing/Airbus (few aircraft engine suppliers)
- **High buyer power:** Walmart negotiating with suppliers
- **High substitutes:** Newspapers vs. online news
- **Intense rivalry:** Airline industry, smartphone market

**Strategic Groups Examples:**
- **Automotive:** Luxury brands (BMW, Mercedes) vs. mass market (Toyota, Honda) vs. budget (Kia, Dacia)
- **Hotels:** Budget chains (Motel 6) vs. mid-market (Holiday Inn) vs. luxury (Ritz-Carlton)
- **Retail:** Discount stores vs. department stores vs. specialty retailers

**Industry Life Cycle Examples:**
- **Introduction:** Virtual reality headsets, lab-grown meat
- **Growth:** Electric vehicles, renewable energy
- **Maturity:** Smartphones, soft drinks
- **Decline:** DVD players, print newspapers

## Integration: Using External Analysis

**Strategic Process:**
1. Conduct PESTEL to identify macro trends and uncertainties
2. Apply Five Forces to assess industry attractiveness
3. Map strategic groups to understand competitive positioning
4. Consider life cycle stage for timing and strategy fit
5. Identify opportunities and threats
6. Match with internal capabilities (links to Week 3 internal analysis)

**Key Questions:**
- Is the industry structurally attractive?
- What are the key success factors in this industry?
- How is the industry changing?
- Where should we compete? (Which segments/strategic groups?)
- How can we influence industry structure favorably?

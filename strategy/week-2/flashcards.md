What is the external environment?	Forces and factors outside the organization that affect its performance and strategic choices. Divided into macro-environment (general) and industry environment (competitive).
What are the six components of PESTEL analysis?	Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, Legal
What is the purpose of PESTEL analysis?	To analyze the macro-environment and identify opportunities and threats from broader societal forces
What are Porter's Five Forces?	1) Threat of new entrants, 2) Bargaining power of suppliers, 3) Bargaining power of buyers, 4) Threat of substitutes, 5) Rivalry among existing competitors
What does Porter's Five Forces framework analyze?	Industry attractiveness and competitive intensity, which determine industry profitability potential
What factors create barriers to entry (threat of new entrants)?	Economies of scale, capital requirements, access to distribution, brand loyalty, government policy, expected retaliation
What factors increase bargaining power of suppliers?	Supplier concentration, high switching costs, forward integration threat, differentiation of inputs, low importance of volume to supplier
What factors increase bargaining power of buyers?	Buyer concentration, low switching costs, backward integration threat, high price sensitivity, low product differentiation
What is a strategic group?	Organizations within an industry following similar strategies or competing on similar bases, sharing similar characteristics (e.g., distribution channels, quality levels, pricing)
What are the four stages of the Industry Life Cycle?	Introduction, Growth, Maturity, Decline
Describe the Introduction stage of the Industry Life Cycle	Low sales, few competitors, high costs, negative profits. Strategy focus: building awareness and establishing market.
Describe the Growth stage of the Industry Life Cycle	Rapidly increasing sales, new entrants, improving profits, product standardization begins. Strategy focus: market penetration and brand preference.
Describe the Maturity stage of the Industry Life Cycle	Slowing sales growth, market saturation, intense competition, price competition increases. Strategy focus: segmentation, efficiency, differentiation.
Describe the Decline stage of the Industry Life Cycle	Falling sales, excess capacity, price wars, competitors exit. Strategy focus: cost reduction, niche focus, or harvest/divest.
What is scenario planning?	A technique for analyzing uncertain futures by developing multiple plausible scenarios based on key uncertainties to prepare robust strategies
What is hypercompetition?	An environment of rapid competitive moves and short-lived advantages, requiring continuous innovation, disruption, speed and flexibility
What are complementors?	Organizations that provide complementary products/services (e.g., software developers complement hardware). Can enhance or reduce industry attractiveness.
How do macro-environment and industry environment differ?	Macro (PESTEL): broad societal forces affecting all industries, less controllable. Industry (Five Forces): competitive forces specific to an industry, more immediate impact on strategy.

# Week 1 Summary - Key Concepts & Frameworks

## What is Strategy?

**Core Definition:**
- Strategy = achieving **sustainable competitive advantage** by being **different, not better** (Porter)
- Competitive advantage = what differentiates you from competitors in customers' eyes
- Must be difficult for competitors to imitate

**Strategy Addresses Three Questions (Porter):**
1. Who should we target as customers?
2. What products/services should we offer them?
3. How can we do this efficiently?

## Strategic Management Process

**Three Interconnected Components:**

```
Analysis → Formulation → Implementation
(All three are co-dependent)
```

1. **Strategy Analysis** - Where are we? Where do we want to go?
   - External: General environment + Competitive environment
   - Internal: Resources, capabilities, strengths/weaknesses

2. **Strategy Formulation** - How do we get there?
   - Choosing between strategic options
   - Requires both analytical thinking AND creative insight

3. **Strategy Implementation** - Making it happen
   - Communication, structure, leadership, culture
   - **Key point:** Strategy without implementation = no strategy at all

## Key Frameworks

### SWOT Analysis (Design School)

**External Analysis:**
- Opportunities (what the market offers)
- Threats (competitive/environmental challenges)

**Internal Analysis:**
- Strengths (what we're good at)
- Weaknesses (gaps/limitations)

**Purpose:** Match internal capabilities with external opportunities

---

### Deliberate vs. Emergent Strategy (Learning School)

**Intended Strategy** → what you plan to do

**Deliberate Strategy** → intended strategy you actually pursue

**Emergent Strategy** → strategy that develops through learning/adaptation

**Realized Strategy** → what actually happens

**Key Insight:** Successful strategies combine deliberate planning with flexible adaptation

---

## Values, Vision, Mission

**Values** = Core beliefs that guide all decisions (never compromised for short-term gains)

**Vision** = Why the organization exists (desired future state)

**Mission** = What business are we in? (communicated to outside world)

**Theory of Business (Drucker):**
- Every organization's theory eventually becomes obsolete
- Must periodically question: Are we still good at this? Would we enter this market today?
- Success can breed failure if you don't adapt

---

## Types of Strategy

1. **Corporate Strategy** - Which industries/markets should we compete in?
   - Mergers, acquisitions, resource allocation across business units

2. **Business Strategy** (Competitive Strategy) - How do we compete in our chosen market?
   - Gaining competitive advantage over rivals

3. **Functional Strategy** - How do functions (R&D, marketing, finance) support business strategy?

## Evolution of Strategic Thinking

**1950s-60s:** Stable environments → Corporate planning

**1960s-70s:** Diversification era (Ansoff)

**1980s:** Porter's competitive analysis → Industry structure focus

**1990s:** Resource-based view (Hamel, Prahalad) → Internal capabilities focus

**2000s:** Hypercompetition (D'Aveni) + Coopetition (cooperation + competition)

## Emotional Intelligence in Leadership (Goleman)

**Five Components (EI is 2x more important than IQ/technical skills):**

1. **Self-awareness** - Recognize your emotions and their impact

2. **Self-regulation** - Manage emotions, create trust/fairness

3. **Motivation** - Desire to achieve for achievement's sake

4. **Empathy** - Consider others' feelings in decisions (critical for global/knowledge economy)

5. **Social skills** - Move people in desired direction, build rapport

**Key Finding:** Emotional intelligence increases with age and can be developed

## Narcissistic Leaders (Maccoby)

**Characteristics:**
- Independent, strong-willed, visionary
- Need adulation and affirmation
- Emerge during times of upheaval/change
- Examples: Henry Ford, Jack Welch, Bill Gates

**Productive Narcissism:**
- Sensitive to big picture
- Communicate vision through skilled oratory
- Attract followers, galvanize change

**Destructive Narcissism (Dangers):**
- Over-sensitive to criticism
- Poor listeners
- Become suspicious and arrogant with success
- Ignore those who disagree

**How to Avoid Self-Destruction:**
- Form close relationship with trusted advisor
- Hire someone to handle execution (e.g., Gates + Ballmer)

## Leadership Capabilities (Groysberg et al.)

**Three Types of Skills:**

1. **General Management Skills** (Highly Portable)
   - Develop vision, motivate employees, monitor performance
   - Transfer easily across organizations

2. **Company-Specific Skills** (Rarely Portable)
   - Knowledge of specific systems/processes
   - Must be unlearned when changing companies

3. **Industry/Relationship Skills** (Moderately Portable)
   - Industry human capital (technical/regulatory knowledge)
   - Relationship human capital (networks, team experience)

**Key Insight:** Success of executive transfers depends on FIT between their skill portfolio and new organization's needs

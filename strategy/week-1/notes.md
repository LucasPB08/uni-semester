## 1.1 Introduction

### What is Strategy?

**Core Questions:**
- What is strategy?
- How is strategy formulated and implemented?
- Are values important in determining which markets organizations seek to compete in?

### Key Points

**Purpose of Strategy:**
- Help organizations achieve a sustainable competitive advantage
- When this competitive advantage is greater than rivals, organizations can identify two broad perspectives:
  1. **Rationalist or positioning approach** - emphasis on fit between organization and external environment
  2. **Resource-based view of strategy** - emphasis on organizational resources/capabilities

**Strategic Management Process:**
- A process that includes strategy analysis, formulation, and implementation
- Essentially linear framework used by organizations
- Has limitations when seeking to explain strategy in practice

**Role of Organizational Elements:**
- Values, vision, and mission are important in setting strategic goals
- Strategy plays a role in achieving organizational goals
- Theory of business discussed as framework for organizational success and failure

### Chapter Structure

- **Section 1.2** - Explains what strategy is and discusses some of its military derivations
- **Section 1.3** - Deals with the strategic management process which explains strategy analysis, strategy formulation, and strategy implementation
- **Section 1.4** - Discusses the impact of an organization's values, vision, and mission in guiding decision making and employees' behaviour (theory of business)
- **Section 1.5** - Briefly discusses different types of strategy: corporate strategy, business strategy, and functional strategy
- **Section 1.6** - Looks at different approaches to strategic management and the changes that have taken place
- **Section 1.7** - Evaluates two different perspectives on strategy formulation: the positioning or design school, and the learning school

---

## 1.2 What is Strategy?

### Historical Origins

**Military Roots:**
- The word "strategy" has existed in management for many centuries, dating back about 400 years
- Strategy was born out of military conflict and war of a superior strategy used to defeat another
- **Von Clausewitz** (nineteenth century) - states that the decision to wage war must apply to the national, regional, and local level
- Based on moral, physical, mathematical, geographical, and statistical factors

**Limitations of Military Analogies:**
- Modern military engagements and military conflicts differ from business competition
- Military conflicts are zero-sum games (one winner, one loser)
- Business competition doesn't have to be zero-sum
- In business, particular course of action may not be uniform across industries
- Goal is sustainable competitive advantage, not total destruction

### Sun Tzu's Principles

**From "The Art of War":**
> "Victorious warriors win the victory and then go to war. Defeated warriors go to war and then seek the victory... Observing the matter in this way, I can see who will win and who will lose."

**Key Insight:**
- Battles are often won in the mind long before enemy forces engage
- In modern business: stakeholders are increasingly aware of the benefit of cooperation as well as competition

### Strategy and Competitive Advantage

**Core Definition:**
- Competitive advantage is at the heart of strategy for an organization
- May usefully be thought of as that which differentiates an organization from its competitors in the eyes of consumers/customers
- Derives from a number of factors including:
  - Products or services
  - Culture
  - Technology/know-how
  - Processes
- To be sustainable, advantages must be difficult for competitors to imitate (Henderson, 1989)

**Competitive Reality:**
- "Your most dangerous competitors are those that are most like you"
- The difference between you and your competitors are the keys to strategy

### Strategy as Decision-Making

**Primary Role:**
- Strategy in decision-making is the primary way managers take account of their organization's changing external environment
- Allows use of the organization's resources and capabilities to exploit opportunities and deal with threats in external environment

**Key Question:** What is strategy and, importantly, how is strategy formulated?

### Porter's Perspective on Strategy

**Michael Porter (1996) - "What is strategy?"**

**Core Principle:**
- Competitive strategy is about **being different, not better**
- It means deliberately choosing a different set of activities to deliver a unique mix of value
- Strategic position represents a company's answers to three questions:

1. **Who should the company target as customers?**
2. **What products or services should the company offer the targeted customers?**
3. **How can the company do this efficiently?**

**Strategic Positioning Process:**
- Companies achieve success by choosing a strategic position which differentiates them from competitors in their industry
- Key factors involved:
  - Match between internal capabilities and external relationships
  - Understanding what an organization is particularly capable of doing
  - Understanding its relationships with stakeholders: employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers
- Strategy is about using analytical techniques to help understand and leverage the firm's influence/position in the market

### Organizational Environment

**External Environment Components:**
- **General environment** - macro-level factors affecting all organizations
- **Competitive environment** - industry-specific factors and competitors

**Internal Environment:**
- The organization's internal resources and capabilities that meet the needs of the external environment

**Key Principle:**
- Organizations do not exist simply to survive, but need to grow and prosper
- To do this, organizations need a fit between their internal resources/capabilities and external environment

---

### CASE STUDY 1.1: What is Strategy?

**Alfred Chandler's Definition:**
- Strategy is the determination of basic long-term goals and objectives of an enterprise
- Adoption of courses of action and allocation of resources necessary to achieve these goals

**Key Themes from Case Study:**

**1. Strategy vs. Tactics:**
- Strategy is not simply an outline of how to achieve goals
- It's about long-term goals and objectives
- Requires understanding how to get there and business contribution

**2. Planning vs. Execution:**
- **British car industry example** - showed that strategic planning can fail without proper execution
- Used domestic appliances in high-street shops (volume of sales), but didn't adapt when transport changed
- Had expertise in routing but didn't maintain it

**3. Military Wisdom Applied to Business:**
- Quote: "No battle plan survives contact with the enemy" (Helmuth von Moltke)
- Organizations need to have a formal strategy as a starting point
- Strategy should guide, but also allow flexibility and adaptation
- Managers and staff sign up and everyone's responsibilities for meeting company's goals
- Formal approach helps with crisis
- Experience at senior level lets companies evolve strategies as they go along
- "Emergent" strategy adapts continuously to the external environment

**4. Strategic Planning Reality:**
- Adage: "Everything in strategy is very simple, but nothing is very easy"
- One of the first things people do is develop useful planning frameworks
- Strategic plans can almost never be executed as envisioned
- The world is complex and unpredictable
- No matter how meticulously detailed plans are, there will always be "headwinds" or "tailwinds"
- Three build-out and thirty iteration levels reveal the original plan usually gets adjusted
- New plan developed instead
- Flexibility is key to good strategic thinking - it's better to be approximately right and flexible than precisely wrong and rigid

**5. Strategy Development Principles:**
- Senior managers carry out what everyone else gets down and gets on with the job
- This is popular
- Everyone is a strategist - everyone contributes to the execution in some way, even if only indirectly
- Every department has a role to play

**Case Study Questions:**
1. What is strategy?
2. What is the importance of strategy to individuals within an organization?

## 1.3 Strategic Management

### Overview

**Purpose:**
- It is necessary for an organization to match to the realities of the external environment in order to achieve competitive advantage
- The process of bringing about the strategy is **strategic management**

**Definition:**
- Strategic management is about analyzing the situation facing the organization
- Analyzing the internal and external environment
- Formulating strategy and implementing it
- Strategic management gives an organization competitive advantage over its rivals in the industry

**Important Note:**
- A point worth noting is that failure to consider how a strategy will be implemented is tantamount to not having a strategy at all
- We might also note that an organizational pattern may not illustrate that each part of the strategic management process is sequential
- Figure 1.1 illustrates the strategic management process
- Analysis, formulation, and implementation need to be considered if the organization's strategy is to meet the needs of the environment effectively

### Figure 1.1: Strategic Management Process

The strategic management process consists of three interconnected components:

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Strategy Analysis  │
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │
           ↓
┌─────────────────────┐
│Strategy Formulation │
└──────────┬──────────┘
           │
           ↓
┌─────────────────────┐
│    Strategy         │
│  Implementation     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

*(Note: The actual diagram shows interconnections between all three components, indicating co-dependence)*

---

### 1.3.1 Strategy Analysis

**Key Principle:**
- Without locating as much detail that the strategic management process is co-dependent
- The undertaking of strategy analysis by the organization is a vital starting point
- Analysis will inform the formulation and implementation of strategy
- An analysis of the general environment and the competitive environment
- Strategy analysis also deals with the organization's internal environment
- Explores how well it is positioned to exploit the opportunities in the external environment

**Questions Strategy Analysis Addresses:**
- Where are we now and where do we want to go?
- Will our strategy get us there?
- Are we using the right business model?
- Do we have the resources and capabilities to achieve our goals?
- What factors drive competition in the industry?
- What factors are affecting the industry?
- In short, without analysis, decisions cannot be based on the facts of a situation

---

### 1.3.2 Strategy Formulation

**Process:**
- A careful analysis of the firm's internal environment and the needs of the external environment will provide the firm with information on where it can gain strategic advantage
- Decision-making occurs between the two
- Without some form of analysis, decision can only be based on experience

**Key Consideration:**
- Experience alone may have been fine in the stable industries of the 1960s, but in today's turbulent environments, organizations cannot expect to follow today's strategy successfully

**Different Perspectives on Strategy Formulation:**

**Mintzberg (1994):**
- Reminds us that strategy formulation also occurs as a **creative act**, and at times, **subconscious act**
- Synthesizes experiences to form a novel strategy
- Cites IBM example that strategic thinking starts with analysis but also requires creative insight in the formulating of great strategies
- Such insight does not come from a pure systematic analysis

**Ohmae (1983):**
- Argues that effective strategic design is a process of continuously asking questions
- Constantly formulating the questions is often more important than finding a solution
- Makes a similar point: states that a vital part of strategy-thinking is to formulate questions in a way that will help find a solution

**Key Principles:**
- Strategy formulation is strategic evaluation which recognizes that an organization can compete in one strategic but requires a premium for competing strategies
- The text discusses two fundamentally different but competing perspectives on strategy formulation
- Strategy formulation primarily takes place at low different levels within the organization: the business level and the corporate level
- Different types of strategy are briefly discussed in **Chapter 5, Section 5.1** (Business level corporate) and strategies are addressed in detail in **Chapters 2 and 6**
- For now we note that as an organization matures or an organization competes in its chosen markets, whereas corporate strategy deals with which markets the firm chooses to compete in

---

### 1.3.3 Strategy Implementation

**Core Challenge:**
- Formulating a good strategy in the world will amount to nothing if it is poorly communicated throughout the organization and incorrectly implemented

**Effective Implementation Requirements:**
- Strategy implementation requires the organization must have a clear idea in its mind of its structure and design
- Strategies need to be communicated, understood, and properly coordinated with stakeholders inside and outside the organization
- Leadership is required to motivate and engage both suppliers and partners
- Although the leader of an organization will ultimately be responsible, leadership is not simply constrained to the top - their role should be to try and develop an organizational culture which empowers managers to respond to opportunities
- In this way each employee will be confident to try out new ideas and innovate without fear of reprisals
- The values of an organization will be important here

**Implementation Fundamentals:**
- At a fundamental level we can ask: What is the purpose of any organization? Why does it exist?
- The question is relevant irrespective of whether an organization operates in the private sector, public sector, or third sector
- All organizations should have a clear sense of what they are about and agreed objectives if they are understand what they are seeking to achieve
- For example, local authority parks services are clear on their expectations
- National government departments have clear expectations
- In the public sector we often see resources in an optimal manner
- Strategic bridges the gap between its lofty aspirations and goals

**Purpose and Goals:**
- Purpose and goals are used interchangeably, but this misses an important distinction between the two
- The goals that an organization sets derive from its purpose
- This will become clearer as we look at the purpose or sense of purpose of organizations and how this guided their strategy

---

## 1.4 Values, Visions, and Mission Statements

### Mission Statements

**Purpose:**
- Mission statements outline the founder of an organization and represent a desired state which the organization aspires to achieve in the future

**Key Characteristics:**
- In contrast with goals and values, the mission clearly identifies what has into the personal goals and values of the organization's employees
- If it is to be internalized by employees, the mission statement can be defined as a way in which the capabilities of the organization and the problems of the organization will be repaired by employees

**Implementation:**
- Implementation is the same as asking the question: What business are we in?
- May appear simple, but answering this question requires imagination
- Requires imagination, intuition, and an ability to synthesize disparate information

**Complexity:**
- A vision statement can be a way to represent and express an organization vision (Kotter, 1996)
- The length and complexity of such statements differ between organizations, but ideally they must be concise and easy to understand and remember

---

### Vision Statements

**Definition:**
- An organization's **vision** seeks to answer the question as to why an organization exists
- A vision statement can be defined as a way in which the organization communicates the business it is in to the outside world

**Drucker (1990):**
- Argues that a mission statement needs to be sufficiently broad to allow for the asking of the question
- A mission statement needs to appeal to a broad spectrum of stakeholders if all these stakeholders are to be motivated
- Should provide a vision which embodies the aspirations of the organization
- Mission statements should not just be a statement of fact

**Stakeholders:**
- While mission statements may not always be successful, they are not unusual, particularly in the public sector
- Organizations have mission statements
- Even for-profit departments at the very down to individual teams
- If these statements are to guide employee behaviour, then it would seem that two scenarios are necessary:
  1. The use of these statements may contribute a necessary but not sufficient factor
  2. Those employees internalize these statements and use them to direct their tour

**Contribution of Mission/Vision Statements:**
- The use of these statements may contribute a necessary but not always being accomplished
- As a result of vision and mission statements, they are not entirely useless

---

### Mission vs. Sense of Mission

**Campbell et al. (1990):**
- Make a distinction between an organization's mission and its sense of mission
- They see a mission as an intellectual concept that can be used to guide the policies of an organization
- However, a sense of mission is an emotional commitment towards the organization
- It occurs when there is a match

**Key Elements of Visionary Organizations:**
- There is a match between the values of an organization and those of the individual
- The key point is that individuals with a sense of vision are committed to the organization
- What it stands for, and what it is trying to achieve

**Collins and Porras (1996) - "Built to Last":**
- Define a visionary organization as being characterized by two defining characteristics:
  1. A core ideology that defines character and purpose (core values are held for financial expediency and short-term gains)
  2. They do not shift in competitive conditions or management fads
  3. It is what members are expected to embody and internalize as part of working for such organization

**Quote:**
- "More than that, it is what attracts individuals to these types of organizations in the first place"
- IBM's former chief executive officer, Thomas J. Watson Jr, put it this way:

> "I firmly believe that any organization, in order to survive and achieve success, must have a sound set of beliefs on which it premises all its policies and actions... The most important single factor in corporate success is faithful adherence to those beliefs... Beliefs must always come before policies, practices, and goals. The latter must always be altered if they are seen to violate fundamental beliefs."
> *(Collins and Porras 1996, p. 74)*

### STRATEGY FOCUS: Core Purpose at Tesco

**About Tesco:**
- Tesco is the UK's most profitable supermarket retailer
- It continues to expand its core business into new markets such as financial services and telecoms
- It expects its employees to internalize the following core values:

**Our Core Purpose:**
- To create value for customers to earn their lifetime loyalty

**Core Values:**
- **Surprisingly simple, Refreshingly honest, And yet incredibly powerful**
- Everything we do is driven by the customer
- Every business decision we take is driven by our customers
- **No one tries harder for customers** - and every employee must demonstrate that sort of getting things done, good at "what" we do, and we take pride in being good at the way in which we do it
- **We treat people how we want to be treated** - We deliver what we say; We believe we can make a difference; We enjoy our work and we encourage and support each other; We know that from our stores we can trust in each other; We have a common way of working
- We have a common way of working, we want people in our business who feel comfortable with these Values and feel they can genuinely influence the future
- They aren't about being soft and lovely, but about being rigorous and single-minded about how we achieve our goals

**Additional Values:**
- Some key points about Tesco said to make it tick today and what it will be in the future:
  - Be energetic, be innovative, and be first for customers
  - Look after our people so they can look after our customers
  - Treat people how we like to be treated
  - Ask more than tell, and share knowledge so that it can be used
  - Trust and respect each other
  - Strive to do our very best
  - Enjoy work, celebrate success, and learn from experience

### Johnson & Johnson Example

**Robert Wood Johnson (Founder):**
- A similar point was made by the founder of Johnson & Johnson
- Johnson wrote what the organization's credo should be in 1943
- Was unusual for his time
- Johnson explicitly recognized the importance of meeting stakeholder needs

**Stakeholders:**
- Stakeholders are those individuals or groups within the organization who have a direct or indirect influence on its operations
- They include customers, suppliers, shareholders, the local community, and the local community itself
- Robert Wood Johnson codified that service to their customers should always come first
- Service to the organization's employees and management should be second
- The local community third
- And lastly service to shareholders
- It is only when this chronology of events occurs that shareholders will benefit

### Theory of Business

**Drucker's Perspective:**
- Drucker argues that every theory of business will eventually become obsolete and no longer work
- There are three aspects of the organization that are important measures
- First is **disablement** - Drucker suggests that every three years an organization must question its markets, products, and policies and ask: are we still good at this? Would we still want to be in it now?
- This forces managers in organizations to decide which markets in which their business is in
- **Fundamental change** - rarely happens within your own company or its own competitors
- This type of change is peculiarity first manifests itself with your non-customers
- We will say much more on detecting changes that might require you to change environment in **Chapter 2**

**Theory of Business Becomes Obsolete When:**
- An organization has achieved its original objective
- At some point the organization's earlier achievement of the objective may point to the need for new thinking
- Rather than being a single fact
- Example: **Sam Walton** (founder of American retailer Wal-Mart) noted:

> "We can't just keep doing what works one time, because everything around you is always changing. To succeed you have to stay out ahead of that change."
> *(Peters and Waterman 1982, p. 81)*

**Thomas J. Watson Jr (IBM):**
- Argued that an organization's basic beliefs should remain constant

> "An organization is to meet the challenges of a changing world, it must be prepared to change everything about itself except its basic beliefs... The only sacred cow in an organization should be its basic philosophy of doing business."
> *(Collins and Porras 1996, p. 81)*

## 1.5 Types of Strategy

There are three basic forms of strategy that interest organizations:
1. **Corporate strategy**
2. **Business strategy** (sometimes called competitive strategy)
3. **Functional strategy**

In reality, most organizations are concerned with each level of strategy and corporate strategy. These are discussed below.

---

### Corporate Strategy

**Definition:**
- **Corporate strategy** is concerned with the broader issues of what industries the organization wants to be in
- It deals with mergers and acquisitions, and allocates resources between the organization's strategic business units (SBUs)
- The Royal Bank of Scotland's takeover of National Westminster Bank was part of their corporate strategy
- As part of this, they moved away from risky bets and towards more prudent corporate strategy
- It often refers to the process of the most senior management within an organization

---

### Business Strategy

**Definition:**
- **Business strategy**, sometimes called **competitive strategy**, deals with how an organization competes to gain a competitive advantage within a particular industry or market
- It is concerned with how the organization will achieve a competitive advantage over its rivals

**Key Characteristics:**
- In contrast to corporate strategy, managers of SBUs who are usually given substantial autonomy, formulate business strategies
- Business strategy is dealt with in **Chapter 3**, where we deal with the competitive environment

---

### Functional Strategy

**Definition:**
- We might note that there is a third category, **functional strategy**
- This deals with decisions according to functional lines such as R&D, marketing, and finance
- These functions will be involved in the support of the business strategy
- Therefore we will place less emphasis on within business strategy in our discussions

---

## 1.6 Changes in the Approach to Strategic Management

**Overview:**
- We have seen strategic management is concerned with how firms achieve and sustain competitive advantage
- However, a major disagreement arises when we look at the extent to which competitive advantage is achieved by the actions of the organization or whether it is simply by being in an industry where organizations both achieve and sustain competitive advantage

**Key Question:**
- There is a clear disagreement on this issue
- But firms might expect research to be able to address the question convincingly here as research findings on both accepted and contested

**Historical Context - 1950s-1960s:**
- The changes in strategic management as a discipline reflect the changing dynamics of modern economies
- For example, during the 1950s and 1960s firms could rely on stable environments
- There was an assumption that organizations could take actions with a relatively high degree of predictability
- It was believed that organizations would engage in corporate planning
- Planning can be seen as an organization's intention to have a formal system because of stability in the external environment
- Stability is defined no longer in some instances
- There were primarily finance-based budgetary control systems
- Giving the assurance that there was some scientific basis to this kind of planning
- Gave a sense of relative stability, which in turn provides for some degree of predictability, however misplaced

---

### 1960s-1970s: Diversification Era

**Market Context:**
- In the 1960s and 1970s the corporate landscape was heeding the drum of diversification
- It is possible to increase market share by increasing product choice
- Ansoff's growth vector matrix explains how organizations can engage in related and unrelated diversification to increase their market shares
- Diversification works well when markets are stable
- It can also increase the capital value of the firm
- It also presupposes that management has sufficient skills and acumen to be competing in markets of which they may have little or no knowledge

---

### 1980s: Porter's Competitive Analysis

**Industry Analysis:**
- In the 1980s, the work of **Porter (1980, 1985)** on industry analysis shifted the emphasis on the primacy of competitive forces between organizations within the industry
- It was about how to match the organization with its competitive environment in a way to select favourably against adversarial forces within their industry
- Adopt a strategy that would compete most effectively
- Porter's work began to focus on the core elements of their business
- This was a period in corporate history which sought to stick to the "knitting"
- A period of "Sound of Excellence" (Peters) and "Waterman" (1982)

---

### 1990s: Resource-Based View

**New Management Techniques:**
- This period of time as the 1990s as new management techniques taught corporate leaders about downsizing, outsourcing, delayering, total quality management, systems value chain thinking, benchmarking, and re-engineering
- Organizations were also creating a framework for understanding the core competencies of the organization

**Contrast with Porter:**
- In contrast with Porter's work the resource-based view was exemplified by the work of **Hamel (1989), Kay (1993), Grant (1991), and Grant (1995)**
- **Hamel (1990), Hamel and Prahalad (1994)** - exalts the organization to look within itself at its own resources and core competencies, and use these as a basis for competitive advantage

**Key Theorists:**
- **Barney (1991) and Schoemaker (1993)** - see the resource-based view of the firm as a comprehensive framework for strategic management
- This framework analysis views the organization from two levels:
  1. The resources and capabilities of the industry and the firm's position within the industry
  2. The resource view sees resources as a fundamental of profitability and the firm's core capabilities

---

### Hypercompetition and Coopetition

**D'Aveni (1994) - Hypercompetition:**
- Coined the term **hypercompetition** to describe the new competitive actions
- It is seen as encompassing maneuvers, developing new products or services for the customer
- For D'Aveni, sustaining competitive advantage (like Porter) becomes increasingly difficult to maintain in the hypercompetitive environment
- Performance and Microsoft is a classic example
- A classic example of a hypercompetitive firm

**Hypercompetition Model:**
- **Chapter 3** will discuss more on hypercompetition
- This represents a new framework for understanding competition
- For example, firms must that hypercompetition is inevitable
- **Karnberg (1994)** argues that turbulence, inasmuch as it meets at all, is an opportunity for organizations convinced from a changing environment
- At the last, it's not about being a fast-decaying turbulence per se
- He is simply pointing out that there is a tendency in strategic management to characterize the previous decades as stable

**Coopetition:**
- And just current decade as turbulent
- Research by **McNamara et al. (2003)** seems to support Karnberg, as they suggest that hypercompetition perspectives may be important but no more so now than they were in recent years

**Benefits of Collaboration:**
- Organizations do not begin to see the benefits of collaboration, cooperation, and joint alliances
- "Networking" has made cooperation organizations become the new buzzword
- The logic is that organizations cooperate in one of competition
- **Brandenburger and Nalebuff (1996)** - refer to this dilema as **coopetition**
- i.e., a blend of competition and cooperation existing simultaneously, in effect a non-zero sum game
- This is discussed in detail in **Chapter 3**

---

## 1.7 Different Perspectives on Strategy Formulation

**Overview:**
- The issue of how strategy is actually formulated has led to claims and counter-claims about how strategy should be made
- There are different schools of thought in strategic management
- The ongoing debate has been largely implicit in strategic management books
- But waged more explicitly in the various strategic management journals (Mintzberg 1990, Ansoff 1991)

**Two Broad Perspectives:**
- There are numerous perspectives on strategy formulation which in many respects generate arguments and polemics
- Mintzberg and Lampel (1999) identify ten fundamentally different perspectives
- We can identify two broad perspectives of strategy management which are fundamentally different ways of making strategy (or different parts of the same process)
- We can identify two broad perspectives of strategy management which are polar opposites:
  1. **The design school**
  2. **The learning school**

---

### 1.7.1 The Design School

**Origins:**
- The design school is associated with the work of **Andrews (1971)** and **Ansoff (1965)**

**Key Principles:**
- According to Andrews, an organization needs to match its strengths and weaknesses (what it can do) with the opportunities and threats that it faces in its competitive environment (what it might do)
- The needs of the community (what it should do)
- And the values and aspirations of the people within the organization

**SWOT Analysis:**
- This provides the familiar **SWOT analysis** of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats
- An external analysis is used to identify its opportunities and threats facing the firm
- An internal analysis of the organization can be used to identify strengths and capabilities

**Strategy Creation:**
- For the design school, the match between these elements will lead to the creation of a number of different strategies
- Each of which can be evaluated and the best strategy can then be selected

**Implementation in 1960s:**
- Then implemented in the 1960s, organizations had planning departments which created strategies for managers to implement
- The role of top management was to translate the appropriate strategy
- Ansoff's product-market matrix was an attempt to help organizations understand how best to allocate their resources among products, markets, and how these fitted with the organization's competencies
- An awareness of this relationship allows the organization to assess more clearly its strategy
- Therefore reduce its risks
- For the past quarter of a century, Porter, more than any other, has exemplified this rationalist approach to strategy formulation using generic strategies

---

### 1.7.2 The Learning School

**Core Principles:**
- In contrast with the design school, **Mintzberg (1990)** argues that a rational approach may not be the best approach to strategy making
- **Quinn (1980)** and **Pettigrew (1985)** suggest three approaches to strategy making: **intended, realized, and emergent strategies**
- An **intended strategy** is one that the organization has explicitly chosen to pursue and will therefore have been worked out in detail
- A **realized strategy** is the strategy that the organization actually carries out

**Strategy Evolution:**
- For a variety of reasons—changes in consumer preferences—the intended strategy may no longer be relevant to market conditions and therefore not implemented
- **Mintzberg and Waters (1985)** argue that the only strategies that are realized are those that originate from their experience and learning to develop an **emergent strategy** which meets the needs of the external environment
- When this emergent strategy is implemented it becomes the realized strategy
- They argue that strategy formulation is far more likely to be a gradual process (incremental) rather than based on any detailed campaign
- This is shown in Figure 1.2

**Figure 1.2: Types of Strategies**

```
Intended Strategy ──→ Deliberate Strategy ──→ Realized Strategy
        │
        ↓
  Unrealized Strategy

Emergent Strategy ──────────────────────────→ Realized Strategy
```

**Mintzberg (1994) on Complexity:**
- Mintzberg points out that strategy is an immensely complex process
- Involves judgement, analysis, learning, insight, and, at times subconscious elements of human thinking
- Strategists can develop haphazardly, without the organization of systematic strategic management
- Often when they are rational strategic planning does not allow
- However, Mintzberg does allow that all viable strategies have emerged and deliberate qualities
- All must combine some degree of flexible learning with some degree of cerebral control

**Key Debate:**
- See **Case Study 1.2: Deliberate and Emergent Strategies** which shows competing perspectives on Honda's success
- Including Honda's success as part of a deliberate strategy
- Mintzberg, in contrast, argues that it results from an emergent strategy

### CASE STUDY 1.2: Deliberate and Emergent Strategies

**Honda and the Supercub**

**Background:**
- Honda and the Supercub is probably the best known and most debated case in business strategy
- In the 1950s, motor cycles were for through specialist outlets welcoming only testosterone-fueled young men
- Bikers were powerful and noisy
- But the Japanese leather-stuffed smell of looking oil
- Honda entered the US market in 1959 and changed this
- Their best selling machine was the 50cc Super Cub
- The company's salesman slogan: **"You meet the nicest people on a Honda"**
- The Honda Cub has sold more than 40 million units since 1958

**Two Competing Explanations:**

**1. Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Report:**
- One school of explanation derives from a report by the Boston Consulting Group for the British government
- Described Honda as achieving an advantage of an archetypal Western approach by Japanese manufacturers of consumer goods
- Having established large economies of scale in their domestic market, Honda was in cost advantage globally

**2. Richard Pascale's Account:**
- A very different history was given by **Richard Pascale**, who went to Tokyo to research Honda's success with the company's executives
- These executives explained that Honda had never imagined that small bikes would be popular in America
- They saw America as a market for larger machines, planning to compete with US manufacturers like Honda
- They had focused on large machines, planning to compete because the shape of their engines made it difficult to sell in California

**The Eyebrows of Buddha:**
- But the eyebrows of Buddha were not appearing in the world of Marlon Brando and James Dean
- The Japanese manufacturers had not their dealers "who treated us discourteously and gave the impression of being motorcycle enthusiasts who sometimes kept our machines they sold"
- **Crucially**, that was not possible in Japan
- Indeed there most of their Super Cubs
- Therefore a major shift of emphasis to smaller machines—the machines they sold
- The Super Cubs to ease their own progress around the asphalt jungle of Los Angeles
- These have experienced mechanical failure also
- And the "nicest people" slogan was invented by a University of California undergraduate as part of their assignment
- Only by lean and believe either Pascale's description or BCG's report

**Analysis:**
- With hindsight, the relative contributions of each approach and the interaction that as outsider genius who made inspired intuitive decisions
- With assistance from the meticulous market analysis of the collegiate and blue collar customers
- **Honda** is an excellent example of emergent strategy
- It is possible to believe that the Harvard account, although admittedly established through diligent research and debate
- The BCG account, although based on rational strategic thought as to emphasize Honda's "core competence"
- The Boston Consulting Group naturally saw the experience curve at work and believed that to be an instance of time-based competition in the manufacture
- Heavy reliance on Mr. Pascale's account as to how Honda was designed and in fact was positioned in deciding what it might be

**The Lesson:**
- The lesson of Honda is that a business with a distinctive capability for developing innovative products to exploit that capability and recognizes the appropriate distribution channels for such innovations can take the world by storm
- And that lesson is valid whether Honda's achievement was the result of careful planning or serendipity

*Source: "Coming through: the pain and Honda's big success" Financial Times, 23 November 2004*

**Case Study Questions:**
1. To what extent can Honda's strategy said to have triumphed?
2. What difference does it make whether Honda's success was as a result of a deliberate or emergent strategy?

---

### Reconciling Different Perspectives

**Finding the Middle Ground:**
- We grouped at the start of this section on different perspectives that the truth often lies somewhere between competing positions and drawn battle lines
- The question is not whether one approach to strategic management is superior to another in understanding
- Failing to take account of more complex processes within strategy making
- Perhaps it is not a question that there does strategic management take forward and analytical
- Clearly, the performance of organizations, and it is so doing increase society's well-being
- Therefore, what we emphasize from others and opposition too

**Both Perspectives Are Valid:**
- The debate between the different schools should show it for what it is
- Often the case, the truth lies somewhere between these two perspectives
- Successful strategy formulation will inevitably involve both analytical techniques and a creative process
- It's a complicated world out there
- We all know we shall get better without emergent planning alongside deliberate planning (Mintzberg 1996)

---

## 1.8 A Strategic Management Framework

**Purpose:**
- A framework is useful to help us structure our thoughts and navigate around the different aspects of strategic management
- If the subject matter of strategy is to enable an organization to formulate and implement strategies to meet the needs of its changing external environment

**Key Elements:**
- Needs to address the process necessary for this
- In Figure 1.3 we outline a framework that covers the key aspects of the organization's environment and its internal resources and capabilities
- However, as we saw in the Strategy Focus on Johnson & Johnson and the Case Study on Honda, a clear sense of an organization's sense of values (or credo), which in turn will direct the goals it sets and therefore the strategy necessary to achieve them
- It is this respect that strategic planning serves a means to an end
- It is the purpose between an organization's values and its strategies that we need to reconcile

Figure 1.3: A framework of strategic management
```

**Framework Explanation:**

Figure 1.3 shows the importance of values in the strategy-making process. Hence the arrow moves from values which determines the goals an organization sets, which in turn determines its strategy.

**Key Relationships:**
- Each need to be clearly stated and evaluated within the organization as they influence its strategy
- Each need to be clearly communicated to stakeholders if requires
- The structures and processes necessary to achieve them
- Goals need to be clearly stated and evaluated within the organization
- The greater the understanding among decision-makers about what the goals are
- The more successful the participants of the organization's strategy
- The organization's goals will reflect its internal strengths and weaknesses and the opportunities and threats within its external environment
- Its internal strengths and weaknesses will also determine the organization structure and the processes it utilizes
- The relationship also reflects the organization's goals and its internal strengths
- The organization will also determine the types of markets

---

### Stakeholder Groups and Strategic Management

**Key Stakeholder Impact:**
- Stakeholder groups are those groups who are impacted by the behaviour of the organization
- And whose own behaviour can, in turn, impact on the organization
- Strategy is to recognize their contribution
- The stakeholder groups in relation to an organization range from stakeholders in strategy
- Strategy is stakeholders

**Stakeholder Categories:**
- Stakeholders could be the external and internal stakeholders
- The external and internal environment, as shown in the diagram
- For example, managers and employees are internal stakeholders
- While suppliers, shareholders, and the community are external stakeholders
- The decision also is not always this simple, since a shareholder may also be an employee of the firm

---

### External and Internal Environment

**Figure 1.3 - Strategic Management and Environment:**
- Figure 1.3 lists strategy and the internal environment once they have initially adopted must meet the organization's values and goals
- Similarly, there is an arrow from external environment once its nature and determines the types of markets

**Implementation Considerations:**
- It will and will not operate within
- This is perhaps most clearly seen in the strategies being pursued of investment fund managers
- The arrow between an organization's strategy and its internal and external environments provides feedback on the appropriateness of the intended strategy
- Perhaps because of a change in market requirements, an emergent strategy may be formed as a result
- The arrow attention to the fact that changes in the general environment may have an impact on the organization's competitive environment
- For example, a decline in the competence environment
- For example, a decline in the general environment resulted in the destruction of the hypermarket industry

---

### Organization Analysis

**Internal and External Analysis:**
- Organizations analyze their internal and external environments, and then develop a strategic response from this analysis
- In line with their strategic priorities
- This response can be to further build on capabilities they currently have
- Seek to exploit or leverage this within their external environment
- This is an interesting response

**Alternative Approaches:**
- Given the debate within strategic management, one hand is the positioning school (Henderson 1989)
- Which is characterized by the work of Harvard professor Michael Porter
- This is often referred to as strategic fit
- On the other hand is the resource-based view that has come to be associated with Gary Hamel and C.K. Prahalad
- This will be addressed in detail in Chapters 3 and 5

---

## Summary

**What is Strategy?**
- In addressing what strategy is, we have looked at different perspectives and a number of definitions
- These different perspectives will have relevance once we assess differential firm performance in later chapters
- The strategic management process covers analysis, formulation, and implementation
- Without any of these the organization will flounder
- The eagle of strategy, may not fully capture how strategy occurs in reality
- This is not to imply that since all organizations need to undertake strategic thinking analysis are largely to take decisions
- It is more to open up thinking about the different ways in which change, deliberate or emergent, occurs
- Whether deliberately planned or not

**Vision and Mission:**
- A vision is often associated with the leader of an organization and represents a desired state which an organization wishes to achieve in the future
- To achieve their vision, objectives, a vision does not change over time
- To be effective, a vision should help rally the purposeful activity of employees
- A mission seeks to answer the question as to why an organization exists
- A mission statement is a way in which the organization communicates the business it is in to the outside world
- A mission statement needs to appeal to a broad spectrum of stakeholders if all these stakeholders are to accept it

**Stakeholder Importance:**
- The research of Collins and Porras into visionary organizations shows the importance of an organization's essential and enduring tenets
- Which will not be compromised for financial expediency and short-term gains
- Purpose represents the reasons an organization exists beyond making a profit

**Theory of Business:**
- Organizations will periodically question whether they are still the best ones on which they are being can no longer be reality
- Drucker refers to this as a theory of business
- The reason that change is increasingly an imperative of the strategy
- The organizations of the strategy, therefore, successful in that their theory of business no longer works

---

### Strategic Management Complexity

**Chapter Overview:**
- This chapter has introduced the reader to some of the complexities that emanate from a study of strategic management
- There are contrasting views and competing definitions
- As we shall see, some of the different schools of thought to offer contrasting perspectives
- This should not be seen as an insurmountable issue since any discipline that seeks to explain the multitude of human behavior will inevitably have debate about its methodology and the rigour of its models operated
- What we have tried to show is that strategy can be an emergent and largely intuitive approach, no more and less dynamic nature of strategic management

**Purpose of Organizations:**
- The purpose of organizations has also been discussed
- This will be more fully evaluated in Chapter 12 on corporate governance

---

## Review Questions

1. How might knowledge of deliberate and emergent strategies help managers when thinking about strategy?

2. Comment on Drucker's assertion that many large organizations are failing because their theory of business does not fit with reality.

---

## Discussion Question

**Topic:** Vision and mission statements are a passing fad with no real links with an organization's strategy. Discuss.

---

## Research Topic

**Topic:** Identify organizations whose success seems to derive from emergent strategies rather than a conscious effort on the part of their senior managers.

# Chapter 11: Strategic Leadership

## 11.4 Emotional Intelligence and Leadership Performance

**Overview:**
- A great deal of research has been undertaken to try to isolate the precise attributes or capabilities that can distinguish effective leaders
- Some of the most interesting work comes from studies that look deeply into leaders' competencies and the capabilities that drive outstanding performance

### Goleman's Three Categories of Leadership Capabilities

**Goleman grouped capabilities into three categories:**
1. **Technical skills** - such as accounting and business planning
2. **Cognitive abilities** - such as analytical reasoning
3. **(3) Emotional intelligence** - which manifests itself in an ability to work with others

**Key Finding:**
- Emotional intelligence proved to be not only the key ingredient for outstanding leaders
- It was actually twice as important as the other two for jobs at all levels

**Traditional Leadership Attributes:**
- Traditional attributes of leaders have usually included such factors as technical skills and IQ
- Common attributes tend to be threshold capabilities or entry-level requirements for executive positions
- They may be necessary for an individual, but they are NOT sufficient criteria for effective performance in leaders

**Goleman (1998, p. 94) states:**
> "When I calculated the ratio of technical skills, IQ, and emotional intelligence as ingredients of excellent performance, emotional intelligence proved to be twice as important as the others for jobs at all levels."

**What Makes Great Leaders:**
- This shows that great leaders require more than an analytical mind or a stream of good ideas
- They need emotional intelligence
- Can assess each of these components of emotional intelligence in more detail

---

### 11.4.1 Self-awareness

**Definition:**
- **Self-awareness** is the first component of emotional intelligence
- Individuals who possess it can recognize emotions as they occur in their own emotional state
- Can understand emotions and the impact of their emotions on their work

**Characteristics of Self-Aware Leaders:**
- Self-aware people can also be characterized by their self-confidence
- According to Goleman, they play to their strengths
- Seek assignments where they can excel
- Honestly assess their ability to work for the organization

**Key Capability:**
- It is this capability of self-awareness that also allows these leaders to honestly assess their own ability to work for the organization

---

### 11.4.2 Self-regulation

**Definition:**
- **Self-regulation** is recognition that as human beings we are driven by our emotions, but we can also manage them and channel them for productive purposes

**Leadership Through Self-Regulation:**
- Leaders who possess self-regulation will not manage their corporate life by charisma, but by trust and fairness
- Self-regulation is helpful in dealing with change in the organization
- Create an environment of trust and fairness, free from deals and impulsive actions
- Are not imprisoned by a change in the company's fortunes

**Benefits in Times of Change:**
- With change and ambiguity, are not easily panicked by a change in the company's fortunes
- Integrity is about corporate power - may have a tendency to occur when leaders have low impulse control
- Perhaps we should take a little of many of the argument that self-regulation enhances integrity

**Note:**
- In some instances the self-regulation of one's emotions may derive more from a fear of the consequences of being "found out" than integrity

---

### 11.4.3 Motivation

**Definition:**
- Among the attributes of effective leaders is **motivation** - a desire to achieve for the sake of achievement

**Characteristics of Motivated Leaders:**
- People who are motivated will be passionate about their work and seek challenges
- Will readily be motivated when they are given opportunities to stretch themselves
- Are committed to their individual performance and that of their organization
- Will not be readily swayed to move for more financial gain
- Seeking to stretch themselves, such individuals will also be looking to improve their organization

---

### 11.4.4 Empathy

**Definition:**
- **Empathy** enables leaders to consciously consider employees' feelings as well as other factors when making decisions
- Means listening to their team and understanding each individual in the team feels

**Importance in Global Economy:**
- In a globalized economy the need for empathy is increasingly important
- Leaders need to understand regional and cultural differences
- Being empathetic allows a leader to read accurately the body language of an individual as well as listening to their spoken words
- Identify is also empathy's equally important what employees require

**Knowledge Economy:**
- Empathy is also important for leaders of the knowledge economy who seek to retain people who are important factor
- Important factor in the knowledge economy

---

### 11.4.5 Social Skills

**Definition:**
- When self-awareness, self-regulation, and motivation are emotional capabilities that will enable the individual to manage themselves, **social skills** enable the ability for managing relationships with others

**Key Functions:**
- Social skills involve moving people in a desired direction
- Open topics partners in a cross-functional team or organizational function - getting participants in the organization to cohere in a way that the leader feels is desirable
- Social skills are the culmination of the other emotional capabilities

**Characteristics:**
- That is, people with social skills are:
  - Persuasive
  - Can find common ground
  - Build rapport
  - Can motivate others
  - Are motivated
  - Can compromise with others
- Therefore social skills are important
- Put them all together and we get the previous four capabilities
- Social skills enable leaders to put their emotional intelligence to work

**Development:**
- What's at stake here is not just emotional intelligence theory
- It is the belief that it can, and furthermore that one's emotional intelligence increases with age
- If so, emotional intelligence is not automatic
- It requires clearly discernible steps and can help
- Pay off in more effective leaders throughout the organization and improved company performance

---

## 11.5 Narcissistic Leaders and Leadership Capabilities

**Overview:**
- We have seen that leaders who possess emotional intelligence are more effective and capable of managing change in organizations than those who do not
- **Maccoby (2000a)** identifies a different type of leader who is equally effective in dealing with and managing change but also has the potential for creating destruction

### Characteristics of Narcissistic Leaders

**Different from Traditional Leaders:**
- Leaders who are transforming industries are different from their predecessors
- Are more strategic than managers who focus on change in the product offering
- Are not necessarily the type who can take care of oneself

**Personality Type:**
- Narcissistic personality types should not be interpreted pejoratively, but descriptively
- Descriptive of an individual who is ambitious for whom living and being loved is important
- Typically these are teachers, nurses, and social workers

**Obsessive Personalities (Contrast):**
- Obsessive personalities are different
- Are always looking for ways to help people learn better
- And tear-win situations

**Narcissistic Traits:**
- Narcissists are independent, stiff-willed, and easily offended

---

### Historical Context of Narcissistic Leaders

**Emergence in Times of Upheaval:**
- Narcissistic leaders have always existed in the past and tend to emerge in times of great social and political upheaval
- As businesses began to reinvent the social agenda, so narcissistic leaders such as **Henry Ford** and **John D. Rockefeller** emerged

**The Problem:**
- The problem is that the type of leaders who they constantly uproot can be equally effective

**Strategic Vision:**
- When strategic vision inspires a narcissistic leader, it represents the antithesis of a leader who adheres to traditional intelligence
- They are willing to go to war
- They can be offensive - the distinction between productive and destructive narcissism

---

### Productive vs. Destructive Narcissism

**Productive Narcissistic Leaders:**
- **Examples:** Jack Welch and Bill Gates
- Are more sensitive to the big picture
- They possess vision and an ability to communicate the vision through oratory
- They have a large belief in themselves and are able to attract followers through their skilled oratory

**Vision and Change:**
- With narcissistic leaders, vision can become blurred, which helps galvanize change
- However, narcissistic leaders need adulation and the affirmation provides their leadership

**The Danger:**
- And herein lies a danger - the very adulation that a narcissistic demands brings self-belief that also allows them to ignore those who disagree with his vision
- This makes these leaders particularly destructive when they lack self-knowledge and are arrogant, self-assured, and ignorant of critics

---

### Weaknesses of Narcissistic Leaders

**As Success Increases:**
- The weaknesses of a narcissistic leader can be seen as they become more successful
- They are over-sensitive to criticism and become increasingly poor listeners
- They can become suspicious
- And resort to rage when someone questions their vision
- They do not want to change, and their aloofness simply reinforces their vision

**Example: Scandinavian Airlines (SAS):**
- In the case of the former CEO of Scandinavian Airlines SAS
- Arrogantly refused to comply with the company's code of conduct which made it public education
- In the 1990s he continued to expand the business with expansive acquisitions while paying too little attention to spiralling costs
- As the organization expanded and losses increased, the brilliant narcissist was eventually fired

---

### CASE STUDY 11.2: Leadership at Microsoft

**Steve Ballmer - CEO**

**Background:**
- Leaders at Microsoft: (left) Steve Ballmer, CEO, and (right) Bill Gates, Chairman
- The relationship between CEO and founder exemplified as it is between most individuals and teams

**Steve Ballmer's Leadership Style:**

**Characteristics:**
- Steve Ballmer is a very big man
- And the chief executive of Microsoft, who is now Bill Gates' boss
- He is a massive guy and has his own standards
- Was once seen publicly fondling a flag, a red flag, down by his own standards
- In 2001, he just carried Seattle, without a tie
- Was given permission to be funny which is formally unacceptable for the head of most companies

**Office Environment:**
- Completed with the cash version of the ubiquitous Office software
- The desks, books, and customers have papers all over the place
- They do their stuff
- The room code is "business casual": chinos, red guts, open-neck shirts, some Cuff links
- And most executives are on first-name terms
- Stopped drinks formally with red wine and life outside
- Inside, coffee, muffins, chrome trucks, and salty red items are in limitless supply

**Communication Style:**
- This atmosphere is all facilities that's into life
- Employees work very long hours in their preferred method of computer networking
- The office label summed and indeed the buildings were like colleges
- People used to walk around in shorts and t-shirts

**Gates Comparison:**
- This is the kind of personally fluid corporate that would have appealed to the painter Edouard Hopper
- Ballmer comes across as inclusive and their demeanor doesn't come from figures based on the use of humor and language
- Language has been created by the deinstitutionalizing language of the conference building

**Leadership Qualities:**
- Gates is a giant in all cases in the software industry, a giant that won't be heard in any specific architectural sensibilities
- This seems to be a claim that never ends in quite end
- Ballmer is also a giant, but Ballmer is a sales-orientated giant
- An American sales director in public and private

---

### Ballmer's Leadership at Microsoft (continued)

**Strategic Communication:**
- Ballmer has mastered the art of amiable shouting
- The volume is always set to maximum, and the message is delivered by the drum-set like eyes in earnest
- He is a leader of geeks and has a comment military air
- Which is a fitting for a business that has a history of saying "Attention from the face of the earth"

**Transformation of Microsoft:**
- Ballmer himself says that where Microsoft was by 2001
- Was the subject of some mechanism or guidance that speaks of the depth of inquiry
- Someone Microsoft sent Google, the internet search engine giant
- According to a sworn statement, Ballmer picked up a chair and threw it across the room when a senior Microsoft engineer told him he had decided to discuss his intentions to join Google

**Competitive Spirit:**
- So did he really throw a chair? He's clearly powerful enough
- He came across a few friends at conferences and was the colorful language?
- "The fucking are going to fucking bury that guy"
- "I have done that in the past"
- "If this had been a verbal session, Ballmer was making points about Microsoft's persistence and tenacity at working rather than relying"
- "We didn't get where we are by being stupid, and working 6 [?] while panicking the air"
- Then somebody says "Did I want to"

**Mission-Driven Leadership:**
- "I want to 20 computers," but I wanted to centralize with Google?
- "I'm going to fucking kill Google"
- Last year he made a commitment, one year ago
- That I was not going to cure

**Emotional Leadership:**
- I know that some of you out there love to lead but I made that commitment to myself
- Is that one of them? I don't recall
- It's hardly a denial
- But you get the sense that he is equally capable of keeping his cool when others are excited

**Energy and Loyalty:**
- He inspires immediate loyalty from his pain and his extraneous energy
- But there is always something about Bill of an analyst who follows Microsoft
- All analysts feel that at the end of the day, he should be seen in the broader picture of Microsoft's business

**Decision-Making:**
- As Ballmer himself says: "I'm just like this you get very face feedback from anybody else"
- People might tell you whether things are good or bad, but frankly, how are you going to aggregate?
- I get a little help from my board of directors once a year

**Relationship with Bill Gates:**
- "But there's what I meant"
- "I am very fortunate to have a guy a bit about our business"
- "Like me and the business, the totality of all in the 60, DO"
- "CEO and Gates's own relationship and about stuff"

**Partnership Philosophy:**
- Well, yes, and no
- The relationship is an interesting and obviously complex one
- Ballmer is focused on technology-famous names in disposed into the conversations
- And there's also a flurry of apparently contradictory sentences: "I called it 'chief software officer'"
- The relationship between us is about a business relationship and a working relationship with my boss

**Personal Friendship:**
- "We're friends," he used to be my boss and I was not his boss
- "We changed that five years ago—because he wanted to, which was an odd thing to itself"
- "I get gratification in our friendship, I get gratification in our partnership"
- It's always gratifying to hear "good job" from Bill

**Distinctive Styles:**
- But clearly the best himself as the natural of the pack: "I think my joint role and partnership with Bill is distinctive and the reasons are distinctive"
- "Bill tends to be more of a deep thinker"
- "I've got the energy"
- "Decide on its own sounds authoritarian"
- "But I'd be—'whoa, whoa, let's go, let's go, in this direction, and a lot of energy'"

**Grammar and Style:**
- The grammar may not be perfect, but there's a classic push from an eight from Drucker
- And most of that package that helps Bill is an important management style
- "I'm not sure everyone that I used to be, but I spend a whole lot more time to work for me"
- "With my energy"

**Impact on Microsoft:**
- "As one of the original three top men at Microsoft (he joined in 1980) from Proctor & Gamble, having first Cutter at Harvard"
- Those who go to the company thank you very much
- "I have clients based in place"
- "He is worth more than a latte at Star, said deans"
- "I have to move literally at this place"
- "One of the questions and how's from all sides, including costumes and backers"
- "I think it's cool that people suggest that much of us"

**Case Study Questions:**

1. Discuss the extent to which the CEO of Microsoft exhibits traits of a narcissistic leader

2. How useful is Steve Ballmer's leadership style for managing change in Microsoft?

3. What components of emotional intelligence do you believe he possesses? State your reasons for this

---

### Avoiding Self-Destructive Behavior

**Key Principle:**
- A narcissistic leader can avoid potentially self-destructive behaviour by forming a close relationship with someone he trusts
- But he must engage in blue-sky thinking because he has Steve Ballmer as president
- Who ensures everything works as it should at board level

**Leadership at Microsoft Example:**
- Leadership at Microsoft begins with the leadership insights into the leadership styles and abilities
- In the organization with your views: Jack Welch did this when he articulated his views and of GE and what he expected of them

**Disagreement and Vision:**
- Those who disagreed with Welch's approach and the culture
- It engendered did not last long at GE
- The structure and character by dramas/merits needs nurses
- And innovators who can create the future

**Challenge for Narcissistic Leaders:**
- The challenge is to get such luminaries in the organization
- To support and themselves the idea that hundreds of the organization can contribute

---

## 11.5.1 Leadership Capabilities

**Overview:**
- We have seen that effective leadership is associated with emotional intelligence and a narcissistic leader, particularly in turbulent times
- We might expect leaders who exhibit these qualities, especially emotional intelligence, to be equally effective in different environments

**CEO vs. General Management:**
- Groysberg et al.'s (2006) research studied 20 former GE executives who became chairman, CEO, or CEO-designate elsewhere
- Using 3-6 month stints of continuous observation as the premier training ground for GE executives
- Wanted to test if the skills these leaders possess are portable
- i.e., does the fact that such leaders performed well at GE mean they will be effective at another organization?

**Key Finding:**
- We might also infer that as these executives were successful leaders at GE, they possessed a far degree of emotional intelligence

---

### Portable vs. Context-Specific Skills

**Market Capitalization Study:**
- A majority of the 20 appointments of an ex-GE executive
- Led to an increase in the market capitalization of the company
- Announcement was greeted with belief by the stock market
- That such individuals possess skills that can easily transfer to different settings

**Examples:**
- **James McNerney** - Hired to turn around ailing 3M in 2000
- **Jack Welch** - They moved directly to GE's CEO to executive-like Hagen-Dazs
- **GE's CEO Jack Welch to Home Depot** - Almost $40 billion
- However, GE also provides us with some executives who are not successful, Groysberg and colleagues

**Key Question:**
- Found that what is important is context
- Or the fit between the executives' strategic resources and the demands of the organization
- A given executive will possess general management skills
- Such as the ability to develop a vision, motivate employees, and monitor performance

**Transferable Skills:**
- These skills are readily transferable to new environments
- However, the same executives will also possess company-specific skills in management systems
- Do not transfer as well
- Therefore the reaction of the stock market is simply a signal that it believes these GE executives have transferable general management skills

### Company-Specific vs. General Skills

**Research Findings:**
- Groysberg et al.'s research found that company-specific skills may also be valuable in various job furthermore
- They found that while skills and competence which helps performance in one job can have an impact when transferred to a new job
- These skills are called **human capital**
- Which emphasize a mix of competence and experience gained in cost-cutting and pursuing growth
- **Industry human capital**, such as technical or regulatory knowledge of a specific industry
- **Relationship human capital**, such as experience and networks that result from working as part of a team

**Outcome Analysis:**
- The outcome of their research is that human capital can be thought of as a portfolio of skills
- Of which some are highly portable, while at the other end are skills which are less portable
- Thus all over skills are part of portfolio of **general management human capital**, which is highly portable

**Three Types of Human Capital:**
- **Company-specific human capital**, which is rarely portable
- In effect it is the first two, the three skills mentioned above are not portable
- But it is the general management skills which is highly portable
- Being the most portable and relationship human capital the least portable of the three

**Performance of GE Executives:**
- This research tells us that the companies that hired these 20 GE executives performed well against the stock market downside when they fit with the market
- But against a number of other criteria and situations they didn't fit
- If not, they performed poorly against the market
- Therefore, the more closely the capabilities of GE executive's new and old organization aligned and the greater their well success in their new role

**Transition Challenges:**
- When executives enter a new industry, their existing industry human capital will not transfer to the new industry
- In fact, it may prove to be irrelevant to the new job
- And will need to be unlearned

**Knowledge Transfer:**
- What this research means for companies thinking of hiring such high-profile star executives is that company-specific skills will not transfer
- And that the skill set a CEO at one company deciding factor should be an understanding of the portfolio of human capital that each CEO candidate possesses
- The insights of where the individual's skillset resides in the organization's strategy and new vision
- It is particularly important when we remember that a CEO's appointment is also viewed as a signal about the organization's strategy and new direction

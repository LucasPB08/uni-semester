# Week 3: Internal Analysis (Chapters 4, 5, SWOT)

## Chapter 4: Value Chain Analysis and SWOT

### Learning Objectives
- Explain differential firm performance
- Discuss value chain analysis and the value system
- Evaluate the role of linkages for creating competitive advantage
- Undertake a SWOT analysis and discuss its limitations

### Key Concepts

**Differential Firm Performance Debate**
- Central question: Why do firms with similar resources in the same industry perform differently?
- Two competing perspectives:
  1. **Positioning School (Porter)**: Industry context and competitive positioning determine performance
  2. **Resource-Based View**: Internal resources and capabilities determine performance
- This chapter introduces both perspectives (RBV detailed in Chapter 5)

### Value Chain Analysis

**Definition**
- A technique to assess an organization's activities by showing where and how an organization adds value
- Helps identify which activities contribute to profitability
- Recognition that internal factors contribute toward competitive advantage

**Primary Activities** (Direct value creation):
1. **Inbound Logistics**: Receiving, storing, and distributing inputs to the product
2. **Operations**: Transforming inputs into final product
3. **Outbound Logistics**: Collecting, storing, and distributing the product to buyers
4. **Marketing and Sales**: Inducing buyers to purchase the product and providing means to do so
5. **Service**: Maintaining and enhancing product value after sale

**Support Activities** (Enable primary activities to function efficiently):
1. **Firm Infrastructure**: Planning, finance, quality control, general management
2. **Human Resource Management**: Recruiting, hiring, training, development, compensation
3. **Technology Development**: Product design, R&D, process improvement
4. **Procurement**: Purchasing raw materials, supplies, equipment

**Key Insight**: Organizations add value through the configuration of their value chain activities and the linkages between these activities

---

### Linkages

**Definition**
- The relationships and interdependencies between value chain activities
- How activities affect each other's cost or effectiveness

**Types of Linkages:**
1. **Within the organization's value chain**: Between primary and support activities, or among primary activities
2. **Within the value system**: Between the organization's value chain and those of suppliers, distributors, and consumers (Brandenburger and Nalebuff 1996)

**Value System**
- Recognizes that an organization's value chain interacts with the value chains of:
  - Suppliers (upstream)
  - Distributors (downstream)
  - Consumers (end users)
- How an organization manages linkages with suppliers, distributors, and consumers impacts value creation
- Aim: Reduce costs or improve differentiation → competitive advantage → margin situation of all parties

**Importance**: Competitive advantage can come from optimizing linkages, not just optimizing individual activities

---

### SWOT Analysis

**Framework Components:**

**Internal Factors (Current state):**
- **Strengths (S)**: Internal attributes and resources that support success
- **Weaknesses (W)**: Internal attributes and resources that work against success

**External Factors (Future potential):**
- **Opportunities (O)**: External factors the firm may be able to exploit to its advantage
- **Threats (T)**: External factors that could cause trouble for the firm

**Purpose and Benefits:**
- Useful and much-used tool for analysis
- Easy to use
- Integrates external analysis (Chapters 2-3) with internal analysis (Chapter 4)
- Should include prior analysis of general and competitive environments

**Limitations:**
1. Analysis may be conducted entirely within the firm's industry boundary (too narrow)
2. Some factors can be seen as both a strength and a weakness (ambiguity)
3. Easy to use but requires careful application
4. Primarily descriptive - doesn't automatically lead to strategy formulation

**Best Practice**: SWOT should incorporate prior external analysis (PESTEL, Porter's Five Forces) for greatest benefit

## Chapter 5: The Resource-Based View

### Learning Objectives
- Discuss the resource-based view of strategy
- Explain the role of resources, competencies and capabilities in achieving sustainable competitive advantage
- Explain how the resource-based view can guide strategy
- Evaluate the importance of knowledge management within organizations

### Key Concepts

**Resource-Based View (RBV) - Core Premise**
- Performance and profitability are determined by an organization's internal resources and competencies
- This is a "radically different perspective" from the positioning school (Porter)
- RBV has "shaken up strategic management" by questioning industry selection and positioning
- Emphasizes the organization's own set of resources and capabilities as determinant of competitive advantage

**The Great Debate: Positioning vs RBV**
- **Positioning approach (Chapter 3)**: Industry structure and competitive positioning matter most
- **Resource-based view (Chapter 5)**: Internal resources and capabilities matter most
- **Conclusion**: It's not either/or - organizations must consider BOTH:
  - Cannot neglect the industries within which they operate
  - Cannot focus solely on industry at expense of internal resources
  - Need to exploit resources to establish sustainable competitive advantage

---

### Resources, Core Competencies, and Distinctive Capabilities

**Resources**
- Tangible and intangible assets an organization uses to implement its strategies
- Examples: Financial resources, physical assets, human resources, organizational processes

**Core Competencies (Prahalad and Hamel)**
- Activities a firm performs especially well compared to competitors
- Source of competitive advantage
- Built over time through integration of resources

**Distinctive Capabilities (Kay)**
- Similar concept to core competencies
- What makes an organization uniquely able to deliver value
- Both are means of achieving sustainable competitive advantage

**Debate**: Slight definitional differences between core competence and distinctive capabilities, but both emphasize internal strengths

---

### Sustainable Competitive Advantage

**Definition**
- Competitive advantage that persists over time
- Competitors cannot easily duplicate or find it too costly to imitate

**Attributes Resources Must Possess** (for sustainable competitive advantage):
Resources must be:
1. **Valuable** - Enable exploitation of opportunities or neutralization of threats
2. **Rare** - Not possessed by many competitors
3. **Difficult to imitate** - Costly for competitors to acquire or develop
4. **Non-substitutable** - No strategically equivalent alternatives available

**Sources of Inimitability:**
- Unique historical conditions (path dependency)
- Causal ambiguity (unclear how the resource creates value)
- Social complexity (culture, relationships, reputation)
- Legal protection (patents, trademarks)

---

### Make or Buy Decisions

**Question**: Should organizations develop resources internally or acquire them externally?

**Considerations:**
- Build on existing core competencies vs acquire new capabilities
- Time and cost of internal development vs external acquisition
- Strategic importance of the resource
- Availability of external resources

---

### Criticisms of the Resource-Based View

**Challenges facing organizations implementing RBV:**
1. Difficulty in identifying which resources truly create sustainable competitive advantage
2. Resources may become obsolete as markets change
3. Causal ambiguity makes it hard to replicate success even within the firm
4. Implementation challenges - knowing you have valuable resources doesn't automatically translate to strategy

**The textbook acknowledges**: While RBV is a powerful lens, it has limitations organizations may experience when trying to implement this approach

---

### Knowledge Management

**Importance in the Knowledge Economy**
- Knowledge has become a critical source of competitive advantage
- How tacit knowledge (hard to articulate, experience-based) might provide a competitive edge
- Organizations must manage knowledge effectively to leverage it strategically

**Tacit Knowledge**
- Knowledge that is difficult to codify or transfer
- Embedded in experience, skills, and culture
- Potentially valuable source of sustainable competitive advantage due to difficulty of imitation

---

### Five-Stage Framework for Strategy Formulation

The chapter examines a framework that integrates resources and capabilities with strategy formulation:

1. Identify and classify resources
2. Identify capabilities
3. Evaluate resources and capabilities for potential to create sustainable competitive advantage
4. Select strategy that best exploits resources and capabilities relative to external opportunities
5. Identify resource gaps and invest to upgrade weaknesses

---

## Integration: Positioning vs Resource-Based View

**Key Insight from Both Chapters:**
- The choice should NOT be either/or between Porter's positioning and RBV
- Organizations must balance BOTH perspectives:
  - **External focus (Positioning)**: Industry analysis, competitive positioning
  - **Internal focus (RBV)**: Resources, capabilities, competencies
- Successful strategy requires:
  - Understanding the industries within which you operate
  - Exploiting internal resources to establish sustainable competitive advantage
  - Finding opportunities where resources match external opportunities

**Integration via SWOT:**
- External analysis (Chapters 2-3) → Opportunities & Threats
- Internal analysis (Chapters 4-5) → Strengths & Weaknesses
- SWOT combines both perspectives

## Exam Focus Areas

**Key frameworks to memorize:**
1. **Value Chain**: 5 primary activities + 4 support activities
2. **Value System**: Suppliers → Organization → Distributors → Consumers
3. **SWOT**: 4 quadrants (S-W-O-T) and their definitions
4. **Attributes for sustainable competitive advantage**: Valuable, Rare, Inimitable, Non-substitutable

**Key concepts to understand:**
- Differential firm performance debate (Positioning vs RBV)
- Role of linkages in creating competitive advantage
- Value chain vs value system
- SWOT limitations (industry boundary, ambiguity, descriptive)
- Difference between resources, core competencies, and distinctive capabilities
- Why RBV "shook up" strategic management
- Sources of inimitability (path dependency, causal ambiguity, social complexity)
- Make or buy decisions
- Knowledge management and tacit knowledge

**Application skills:**
- Identify primary vs support activities in value chain
- Recognize linkages within and between value chains
- Conduct SWOT analysis that integrates external and internal factors
- Distinguish between core competencies (Prahalad/Hamel) and distinctive capabilities (Kay)
- Evaluate resources for sustainable competitive advantage potential
- Balance positioning and resource-based perspectives

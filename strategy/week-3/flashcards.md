What are the 5 primary activities in the value chain?	1) Inbound logistics, 2) Operations, 3) Outbound logistics, 4) Marketing and Sales, 5) Service
What are the 4 support activities in the value chain?	1) Firm infrastructure, 2) Human resource management, 3) Technology development, 4) Procurement
What is the purpose of value chain analysis?	To assess an organization's activities by showing where and how the organization adds value, helping identify which activities contribute to profitability
What are linkages in the value chain?	The relationships and interdependencies between value chain activities - how activities affect each other's cost or effectiveness
What is a value system?	Recognition that an organization's value chain interacts with the value chains of suppliers (upstream), distributors, and consumers (downstream)
What are the four quadrants of SWOT analysis?	Strengths (internal), Weaknesses (internal), Opportunities (external), Threats (external)
What are three limitations of SWOT analysis?	1) Analysis may be too narrow (within industry boundary only), 2) Factors can be ambiguous (both strength and weakness), 3) Primarily descriptive (doesn't lead to strategy)
What is the differential firm performance debate?	The central question: Why do firms with similar resources in the same industry perform differently? Positioning School vs Resource-Based View
What is the Resource-Based View (RBV)?	Performance and profitability are determined by an organization's internal resources and competencies, not just industry positioning
What is Porter's positioning perspective?	Industry structure and competitive positioning (e.g., Five Forces) determine performance - focus on external factors and strategic positioning
What are core competencies (Prahalad and Hamel)?	Activities a firm performs especially well compared to competitors, built over time through integration of resources, source of competitive advantage
What are the 4 attributes resources must have for sustainable competitive advantage?	1) Valuable, 2) Rare, 3) Difficult to imitate, 4) Non-substitutable
What are the sources of inimitability?	1) Unique historical conditions (path dependency), 2) Causal ambiguity, 3) Social complexity, 4) Legal protection (patents)
What is causal ambiguity?	When the link between a firm's resources and competitive advantage is not well understood, making imitation difficult even when competitors are aware of the advantage
What is tacit knowledge?	Knowledge that is difficult to codify or transfer, embedded in experience, skills, and culture - potentially valuable for competitive advantage due to difficulty of imitation
What is the key conclusion about Positioning vs RBV?	It's not either/or - organizations must consider BOTH: understand the industries they operate in AND exploit internal resources for sustainable competitive advantage
What is the purpose of linkages in creating competitive advantage?	Competitive advantage can come from optimizing linkages (relationships between activities), not just optimizing individual activities themselves
What does SWOT analysis integrate?	External analysis (Opportunities & Threats from Chapters 2-3) with internal analysis (Strengths & Weaknesses from Chapters 4-5)

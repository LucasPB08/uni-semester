# Week 4 - Strategy Formulation I

**Chapters:** 6 (Organizational Performance), 7 (Business-Level Strategy), 8 (Corporate-Level Strategy), + TOWS

---

## Chapter 6: Organizational Performance

### Key Definitions

**Shareholder maximization** - Approach that assumes the purpose of organizations is to add value for shareholders

**Stakeholder approach** - Argues corporations need to take account of wider societal needs to grow responsibly and sustainably

**Economic Value Added (EVA)** - Measure that focuses on value creation for shareholders; complements traditional financial ratios

**Balanced Scorecard** - Performance assessment approach that includes stakeholders (not just financial data); measures achievement of strategy objectives

**Benchmarking** - Comparing organizational performance against competitors or best-in-class firms to improve performance

### Key Concepts

**The fundamental question:** Who is the organization there to serve?
- Two main perspectives: shareholder value vs. stakeholder value
- Performance measurement choice reflects this fundamental decision

**Financial vs. Non-Financial Measures:**
- Traditional approach: financial ratios (accounting profit)
- Alternative measures: economic profit, EVA
- Balanced scorecard: looks beyond financial data to include customer, employee satisfaction, etc.

**Challenge of implementation:**
- Balanced scorecard includes stakeholders in assessment
- Difficulty is translating concepts into implementation (see Case Study: Applying a Balanced Scorecard)

**Benchmarking approach:**
- Should not be limited to direct competitors only
- Compare against competitors outside your industry (best-in-class)
- Best-practice frameworks can be adapted to suit the firm's unique needs
- Example: Xerox (mentioned in chapter conclusion)

### Frameworks/Models

**Balanced Scorecard** - Assesses performance across multiple dimensions:
- Financial perspective
- Customer perspective
- Internal business processes
- Learning and growth perspective
- Aligns with organization's strategic objectives

**Financial Ratios** - Traditional tools to assess organizational performance (Section 6.5)

**Economic Value Added (EVA)** - Alternative financial measurement developed by Kaplan and Norton

## Chapter 7: Business-Level Strategy

### Key Definitions

**Corporate strategy** - Asks "what markets shall we compete in?"

**Business strategy** - Asks "how are we going to compete in our chosen industry or markets?"
- Concerned with how an organization competes in its chosen industry
- Aims to achieve sustainable competitive advantage at individual business unit level or within distinct market segments

**Generic competitive strategies** - Overall strategic positioning options: cost leadership, differentiation, and focus

**Stuck in the middle** - When an organization fails to clearly pursue one strategy; leads to poor performance

**Resource-Based View (RBV)** - Approach to strategy formulation that focuses on matching internal resources and capabilities to the external environment
- Profit derives from two sources: (1) external environment (industry attractiveness), (2) internal resources and capabilities

**Industry life-cycle** - The stages industries go through: introduction, growth, maturity, and decline

**Market turbulence/Hypercompetition** - Rapidly changing competitive environments with competence-destroying disruptions

### Key Concepts

**Strategy formulation as deliberate decision-making:**
- Non-linear incremental process (strategy emerges, not just planned)
- Must be mindful of ability to implement during formulation
- Choice of performance measures = stakeholder focus (Chapter 6)
- Strategy being pursued may be a result of emergent factors

**Porter's approach vs. RBV:**
- Porter: Strategy requires different capabilities, therefore pick ONE strategy (don't get stuck in the middle)
- RBV: Match internal resources/capabilities to external environment needs
- RBV focuses on sustainability of competitive advantage (what resources center around, ability of firm to create/sustain advantage)

**Industry life-cycle implications:**
- Different stages have different competitive conditions
- Within an industry, different strategic groups may experience different stages
- Product life-cycle vs. industry life-cycle can be discerned following same stages
- Industry life-cycle = supply-side equivalent of product life-cycle

**Turbulent markets:**

Market turbulence can occur due to two types of disruptions:
- **Competence-destroying disruptions**: Changes in customer tastes, technological substitution, or obsolescence that destroy the leader's competencies by changing critical success factors
- **Competence-enhancing disruptions**: Make the leader's existing competencies MORE valuable

Disruptions can occur infrequently or constantly, resulting in four competitive environments:

| Environment | Characteristics | Leader Strategy | Challenger Strategy |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Equilibrium | Long periods of little/no competence-destroying turbulence | Exercise control through barriers to entry | Make barriers to entry irrelevant |
| Fluctuating equilibrium | Rapid turbulence from frequent competence-ENHANCING disruptions | Leverage enhanced competencies | Destroy leader's core competencies; push toward punctuated equilibrium or disequilibrium |
| Punctuated equilibrium | Brief dynamic periods of discontinuous/competence-destroying change, then stability | Decide when and how to respond to next revolution | Disrupt the stability the leader seeks |
| Disequilibrium | Most challenging; frequent AND discontinuous disruptions (hypercompetition) | Constantly create new competencies; deliberately self-disrupt before rivals do | Disrupt in ways that can't be matched, or make environment less disruptive |

**Example - Disequilibrium:** Microsoft continuously introduces new software that intentionally cannibalizes their existing products (self-disruption before competitors can disrupt them)

### Frameworks/Models

**Porter's Generic Competitive Strategies** (Section 7.3):
1. **Overall Cost Leadership** - Organization seeks to offer products at a lower price than competitors
2. **Differentiation** - Organization delivers a product which consumers perceive to be better value than competitors (not just price - could be quality, features, brand, etc.)
3. **Focus** - Organization targets a particular market niche and tailors strategy to serve that segment better

Key principle: Must choose which market segments products will compete within (broad vs. particular niche)
Risk: Getting "stuck in the middle" between strategies

**Resource-Based View (RBV)** (Section 7.4):
- Alternative approach to Porter's generic strategies
- Primary focus: INTERNAL capabilities/resources rather than external environment positioning
- Match internal resources to needs of external environment
- Profit comes from both external attractiveness AND internal capabilities

**Industry Life-Cycle** (Section 7.5):
Four stages:
1. Introduction
2. Growth
3. Maturity
4. Decline

Understanding the stage helps organization formulate appropriate business strategy

**Market Turbulence/Hypercompetition Framework** (Section 7.6):
Examines impact of rapidly changing markets on strategy
- Four different competitive environments
- Better understanding of strategy-environment interaction leads to better strategies

## Chapter 8: Corporate-Level Strategy

### Key Definitions

**Corporate strategy** - Concerned with the question: "What businesses do we want to compete in?"
- Defines which industries and markets the organization competes in
- Determines how resources are allocated across business units
- Overall direction for the organization determined by the corporate parent

**Corporate parent** - The entity that adds value across business units
- Measure of value: Is value added by corporate parent greater than if business units managed independently?
- When corporate parent adds greater value, organization achieves **synergy**

**Synergy** - When total output from combining businesses is greater than sum of output if businesses operated independently

**Growth strategies** - Four options for organizational growth:
1. Market penetration
2. Product development
3. Market development
4. Diversification
Each carries different risk levels predicated on organization's resources and capabilities

**Related diversification** - Broadening scope of activities into businesses with connections/similarities (vertical or horizontal integration)

**Unrelated diversification** - Broadening scope into businesses with no clear connections to existing activities

**Corporate parenting approach** - Parent company uses its value creation insights and distinctive parenting characteristics to identify a "heartland" of businesses where it can add substantial value
- Similar to resource-based view
- Evaluates whether value added by corporate parent > value if business units managed independently

**Strategy evaluation** - Assessment of strategy effectiveness (Section 8.9)

### Key Concepts

**Purpose of corporate strategy:**
- When organization is made up of multiple business units, role arises to allocate resources across businesses
- Purpose and objectives of organization guide strategic decisions
- Once organizational objective determined (e.g., maximize shareholder value, meet stakeholder needs), this guides overall direction
- Corporate parent's role = add value across business units

**Growth strategy selection:**
- Choice depends on: technology needs, speed requirements, market access, competitive threats
- Where organization seeks to broaden scope, must decide HOW to diversify

**Methods to implement corporate strategies:**
- Internal developments
- Mergers and acquisitions
- Joint ventures
- Strategic alliances
- Choice guided by evaluation of strategic position and strategic options

**Portfolio analysis evolution:**
- Popular method in past for assessing business performance
- Boston Consulting Group (BCG) portfolio matrix
- General Electric screen matrix
- These became widely used as corporations focused on core activities ("stick to the knitting")
- Helps allocate resources efficiently across business units

**Corporate parenting effectiveness:**
- Some instances where corporate parent adds value
- Some instances where value is destroyed
- Must measure: Is value added by parent > value if units independent?

**Strategy evaluation requirements:**
- Executives must be aware of organization's internal resources and capabilities
- Must understand how these meet needs of external environment
- Must incorporate opinions of stakeholders who have power and influence to affect strategy

### Frameworks/Models

**Growth Strategies (Ansoff Matrix implied)** - Four strategies:
1. **Market penetration** - Existing products in existing markets
2. **Product development** - New products in existing markets
3. **Market development** - Existing products in new markets
4. **Diversification** - New products in new markets (highest risk)

**Diversification Types:**
- **Related diversification** (vertical/horizontal integration) - Transaction cost analysis to assess make vs. buy decisions
- **Unrelated diversification** - Evidence suggests mixed results; consider performance of successful organizations in diverse business activities

**Portfolio Analysis Tools:**
1. **Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Portfolio Matrix** - Evaluates business units based on market growth and market share
2. **General Electric Screen Matrix** - Multi-factor portfolio analysis tool

Both help organization allocate resources more efficiently across business units

**Corporate Parenting Approach:**
- Parent identifies "heartland" businesses where it can add substantial value
- Uses distinctive parenting characteristics
- Links to resource-based view (both focus on internal capabilities creating value)

## TOWS Matrix

### What is TOWS?

TOWS is SWOT rearranged (Threats, Opportunities, Weaknesses, Strengths). While SWOT is primarily **analytical** (listing factors), TOWS is **action-oriented** - it generates strategic options by systematically matching internal and external factors.

### The TOWS Matrix

|                        | **Strengths (S)**                     | **Weaknesses (W)**                     |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Opportunities (O)**  | **SO Strategies** (Maxi-Maxi)         | **WO Strategies** (Mini-Maxi)          |
| **Threats (T)**        | **ST Strategies** (Maxi-Mini)         | **WT Strategies** (Mini-Mini)          |

### The Four Strategy Types

**SO Strategies (Strengths + Opportunities)** - "Maxi-Maxi"
- Use internal strengths to exploit external opportunities
- Most aggressive/growth-oriented strategies
- Example: Strong R&D capability + growing market demand → launch new products

**WO Strategies (Weaknesses + Opportunities)** - "Mini-Maxi"
- Overcome internal weaknesses by exploiting external opportunities
- Often involves acquiring resources or capabilities
- Example: Weak distribution network + e-commerce growth → partner with online retailers

**ST Strategies (Strengths + Threats)** - "Maxi-Mini"
- Use internal strengths to mitigate external threats
- Defensive strategies leveraging competitive advantages
- Example: Strong brand loyalty + new competitor entering → emphasize brand differentiation

**WT Strategies (Weaknesses + Threats)** - "Mini-Mini"
- Minimize weaknesses and avoid threats
- Most defensive; may involve retrenchment, divestment, or liquidation
- Example: High costs + price war → exit unprofitable segments

### Key Concepts

**TOWS vs. SWOT:**
- SWOT = analysis (what are our factors?)
- TOWS = synthesis (what should we do about them?)
- TOWS bridges the gap between analysis and strategy formulation

**How to use TOWS:**
1. Complete SWOT analysis first
2. Create the matrix with S, W, O, T factors
3. Systematically match each combination (SO, WO, ST, WT)
4. Generate multiple strategic options for each quadrant
5. Evaluate and prioritize strategies

**Integration with Week 4 content:**
- TOWS generates strategic options at both business and corporate levels
- SO/ST strategies often align with Porter's differentiation or cost leadership
- WO strategies may involve growth methods from Ch 8 (M&A, alliances)
- WT strategies may involve portfolio decisions (divest, exit)

## Summary - Strategy Formulation Overview

**What we're doing in Week 4:**
After analyzing the external environment (Week 2) and internal environment (Week 3), we now move to **choosing a strategy**

**The three-level framework:**

1. **Chapter 6: How do we measure success?**
   - Shareholder vs. stakeholder approach determines performance measures
   - Balanced scorecard, EVA, benchmarking

2. **Chapter 7: How do we compete?** (Business-level strategy)
   - Porter's generic strategies: cost leadership, differentiation, focus
   - Resource-based view: match internal capabilities to external needs
   - Context: industry life-cycle and market turbulence

3. **Chapter 8: What businesses should we be in?** (Corporate-level strategy)
   - Growth strategies: market penetration, product/market development, diversification
   - Related vs. unrelated diversification
   - Corporate parenting: Does the parent add value across business units?
   - Portfolio analysis (BCG matrix, GE matrix)

**Key tensions:**
1. **Who do we serve?** Shareholders vs. stakeholders (affects performance measurement)
2. **How do we compete?** External positioning (Porter) vs. internal capabilities (RBV)
3. **What level of strategy?** Business-level (how to compete in one industry) vs. corporate-level (which industries to compete in)
4. **How do we grow?** Organic growth vs. M&A vs. alliances; related vs. unrelated diversification

**Integration:**
- Strategy formulation must consider BOTH external analysis (Porter's 5 Forces from Ch 2) AND internal analysis (resources/capabilities from Ch 4-5)
- Performance measurement (Ch 6) must align with chosen strategic direction
- Business-level strategy (Ch 7) focuses on competing within an industry
- Corporate-level strategy (Ch 8) focuses on which industries to compete in and resource allocation
- Context matters: industry life-cycle stage and market turbulence affect strategy choice
- Corporate parent must add value (synergy) or business units better off independent

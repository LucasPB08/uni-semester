# Week 7: Globalization and International Strategy

**Chapter 9 - Competing in the Global Environment**

---

## Key Definitions

**Globalization** - The increasing integration of international markets and the debate over whether consumer preferences are becoming homogenized across borders or whether important national differences persist.

**Administrative Heritage** - An organization's internal capabilities that may constrain its ability to respond to environmental changes (term by Bartlett and Ghoshal).

**Comparative Advantage** - The role that different factors play in providing a nation with competitive advantage in international markets.

---

## Frameworks/Models

### Ghoshal's Globalization Framework

A framework for guiding managers of multinational corporations, combining **three strategic objectives** with **three sources of competitive advantage**.

**Strategic Objectives:**
1. **Achieving efficiency** in current operations
2. **Managing risks**
3. **Innovation, learning, and adaptation**

**Sources of Competitive Advantage:**
1. **National differences** - Exploiting differences in factor costs, market conditions, policies across countries
2. **Scale economies** - Expanding and exploiting potential scale economies in each activity
3. **Scope economies** - Sharing investments and costs across products, markets, and businesses

| Strategic Objective | National Differences | Scale Economies | Scope Economies |
|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Achieving efficiency** | Benefiting from differences in factor costs (wages, capital) | Expanding and exploiting scale economies in each activity | Sharing investments and costs across products, markets, businesses |
| **Managing risks** | Managing different risks from market/policy-induced changes across countries | Balancing scale with strategic and operational flexibility | Portfolio diversification of risks; creation of side-bets |
| **Innovation, learning, adaptation** | Learning from societal differences in organizational and managerial processes | Benefiting from experience—cost reduction and innovation | Shared learning across organizational components in different products, markets, businesses |

### Four Types of International Strategy

Response to the globalization-localization debate:

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Multidomestic** | High local responsiveness, low global integration; products/services adapted to each national market |
| **International** | Leveraging home-country innovations abroad with some local adaptation |
| **Global** | High global integration, low local responsiveness; standardized products/services worldwide |
| **Transnational** | Simultaneously achieves global efficiency, national responsiveness, AND worldwide leveraging of innovations and learning |

**Key insight:** The transnational organization (Bartlett & Ghoshal) recognizes that matching an organization's capabilities to a single set of environment forces no longer holds. Neither a multidomestic nor an international nor a global strategy alone is sufficient.

### Porter's Diamond of National Advantage

Explains how organizations achieve competitive advantage abroad based on four attributes in their home nation:

```
         Factor Conditions
               /\
              /  \
             /    \
Demand      /      \  Related & Supporting
Conditions /________\ Industries

      Firm Strategy, Structure, & Rivalry
```

**Four attributes:**
1. **Factor Conditions** - Nation's position in factors of production (skilled labor, infrastructure)
2. **Demand Conditions** - Nature of home-market demand for the product/service
3. **Related and Supporting Industries** - Presence of supplier industries and related industries that are internationally competitive
4. **Firm Strategy, Structure, and Rivalry** - Conditions governing how companies are created, organized, and managed; nature of domestic rivalry

Each point of the diamond contributes to global success.

**Criticism:** Rugman and D'Cruz argue that smaller nations' competitive advantage may actually derive from attributes in their larger foreign diamond. Rugman suggests using a **Double Diamond Framework** to account for this.

### Entry Mode Strategies

Based on two key questions:
1. What level of **resource commitment** is the organization prepared to make?
2. What level of **control** over international operations does it require?

The answers are determined by an organization's **perception of international risk**.

**Trade-off:** Higher control typically requires higher resource commitment and exposure to risk.

## Key Concepts

### The Globalization Debate

**Theodore Levitt's View:**
- Consumer preferences are "irrevocably homogenized"
- Advocates for global standardization

**Counter-argument (Douglas and Wind):**
- While global segments with similar needs exist, this is NOT a universal trend
- Important national differences persist and cannot be ignored

**Central question:** To what extent should organizations develop global brands and products for all markets vs. adapting to international diversities (consumer preferences, national differences)?

### Motives for International Expansion

Organizations expand abroad due to two types of factors:

| Organizational Factors | Environmental Factors |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Occur within the firm | Outside the firm's control |
| Internal capabilities | Market opportunities |
| Resource advantages | Competitive pressures |

### The Transnational Imperative

Modern organizations must simultaneously achieve:
1. **Global efficiency** - Cost advantages through standardization and scale
2. **National responsiveness** - Adapting to local market needs
3. **Worldwide leveraging** - Sharing innovations and learning across borders

This represents a shift from "either/or" thinking to "and" thinking in international strategy.

### Globalization Myths

The chapter challenges prevailing myths about globalization and questions whether truly globalized companies actually exist.

### Opportunities and Challenges of Global Integration

**For globally integrated enterprises:**
- Rapid dispersal of knowledge and distinctive capabilities across borders
- Achieving synergies across international operations
- Coping with external changes more readily

**For national governments:**
- Balancing openness to global trade with protecting domestic interests
- Policy implications of multinational operations

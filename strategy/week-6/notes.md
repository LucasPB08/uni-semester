## Chapter 10: Organizational Structures, Processes & Strategic Change

### Learning Objectives
- Explain the trade-off between specialization and coordination
- Evaluate the role of different organizational structures
- Assess the impact of organizational processes on innovation and knowledge
- Evaluate strategic control systems
- Assess different approaches to strategic change
- Discuss the determinants of a visionary organization

---

### Key Concepts

**Strategy Implementation vs Formulation**
- The best formulated strategy in the world will fail if it is poorly implemented
- Organizations must be sufficiently flexible in their organizational design
- Strategies need to be effectively communicated and properly resourced
- Reason for change must be understood and coordinated with stakeholders inside and outside the organization

**The Role of Leadership in Implementation**
- Leader is ultimately responsible for strategy's success or failure
- Leader's role: encourage and create an organizational culture that empowers managers to respond to opportunities
- Employees should be confident to try out new ideas and innovate without fear of reprisals
- Appropriate reward mechanisms guide employee behavior and signpost important goals
- Values of organization specify what it stands for

**The Human Element**
- Although systems, procedures, and policies may aid implementation, ultimately it is individuals who implement strategy
- Unless individuals and groups (within and outside organization) accept the rationale for strategic change, any proposed implementation will be suboptimal at best

---

### Organizational Structures (Section 10.2)

**The Specialization-Coordination Trade-off**
- Organizations must balance specialization (efficiency through division of labor) with coordination (ensuring parts work together)
- Different structures represent different solutions to this trade-off

**Types of Organizational Structures:**

1. **Simple Structure** - Basic, centralized structure for small organizations

2. **Functional Structure** - Organized by business functions (marketing, finance, operations, etc.)

3. **Divisional Structure** - Organized by product lines, geographic regions, or customer segments

4. **Matrix Structure** - Dual reporting relationships (e.g., functional AND product/project)
   - Initially held promise for managing complex and dynamic environments
   - Has been "found wanting" - proved costly and burdensome
   - Violates unity of command and creates complex interactions

5. **Network Structure** - Loose, flexible arrangements where organizations outsource many functions and coordinate through relationships rather than hierarchy
   - Focus on core competencies internally, partner externally for everything else
   - Highly flexible and adaptable with lower fixed costs
   - Relies on trust and contracts with partners
   - Examples: Nike (designs/markets but outsources manufacturing), film production companies (assemble specialists per project)

**Ghoshal and Bartlett's Response to Matrix Limitations:**
- Argue for a focus on organizational processes rather than merely making structural changes
- Advocate for a more integrative approach
- Goes beyond the limitations inherent in merely making structural changes

---

### Organizational Processes (Section 10.3)

**Key Focus:**
- Impact of organizational processes on innovation and knowledge sharing
- Moving beyond structures to assess how processes help individuals innovate and share knowledge across the organization

---

### Strategic Control Systems (Section 10.4)

**Definition:** Mechanisms that allow strategy to be evaluated against stated aims and allow for changes if necessary

**Goold and Quinn's Framework:**
- Three reasons for establishing a strategic control system
- Contingency framework highlighting different conditions when strategic control systems might be useful

**The 2x2 Matrix:**
|  | Low Turbulence | High Turbulence |
|--|----------------|-----------------|
| **Can measure objectives** | Control systems very useful | Control systems partially useful |
| **Cannot measure objectives** | Control systems less useful | Control systems impractical |

- **Environmental turbulence** = How stable/predictable is the environment? (Links to Week 4: equilibrium → low turbulence; hypercompetition/disequilibrium → high turbulence)
- **Ability to state and measure strategic objectives** = Can you set clear, measurable targets?

**Implication:** In highly turbulent environments where you can't measure objectives clearly, formal strategic control systems become impractical - need more adaptive approaches

**The Inherent Tension:**
- Trying to ensure managers work towards a common goal
- While also allowing them to develop innovative business solutions without constraints
- Control systems must balance accountability with creativity

---

### Strategic Change (Section 10.5)

**Two Types of Change:**
1. **Evolutionary Change** - Gradual, incremental adjustments
2. **Revolutionary Change** - Dramatic, discontinuous transformation

**Greiner's Growth Model:**
Organizations evolve through stages, each ending in a crisis that must be resolved to move forward:

| Stage | Growth Through... | Ends in Crisis of... |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Creativity | Leadership (founders can't manage scale) |
| 2 | Direction | Autonomy (too centralized, employees feel restricted) |
| 3 | Delegation | Control (too decentralized, headquarters loses grip) |
| 4 | Coordination | Red Tape (too many systems, bureaucracy slows things down) |
| 5 | Collaboration | Internal growth limits (need external solutions) |

**Key insight:** What makes you successful in one stage becomes your problem in the next. The solution to each crisis plants the seeds of the next crisis.

**Integrative Change:**
- Change needs to be part of a coherent and stable system
- Must recognize the role of complements (different elements supporting each other)

**Visionary Organizations:**
- Discussion of what makes organizations "great"
- Use of **BHAGs (Big Hairy Audacious Goals)** to guide onward progress
- How "great" companies deal with strategic change

---

## Chapter 11: Strategic Leadership

### Learning Objectives
- Explain the difference between leadership and management
- Discuss the role of leaders in creating a learning organization
- Evaluate the impact of emotional intelligence on effective leadership
- Assess the benefits and dangers of a narcissistic personality trait
- Discuss the role of leaders in developing a shared vision and shaping values
- Assess the effects of different national cultures on leadership
- Assess the leadership skills necessary for directing strategic change
- Discuss the impact of chaos on innovation and strategic direction

---

### Key Concepts

**Leadership as Key Success Factor**
- Quality of strategic leadership at the top is a key factor in effective strategy implementation
- Ability of leaders to communicate organizational goals clearly and guide employees is crucial to success
- Equally relevant in public, private, and not-for-profit sectors

**Empowerment and Development**
- Without effective leadership at the top, individuals throughout the organization will be less likely to be empowered
- Less empowered individuals are less likely to develop their own leadership skills
- Leader's role: create organizational culture that empowers individuals to respond to opportunities

**Speed of Learning as Competitive Advantage**
- The speed with which organizations learn may be a source of sustainable competitive advantage (Stalk 1988)
- Challenge for leaders: create organizations in which people continually learn

---

### Management vs Leadership (Section 11.2)

**Key Distinction:**
- **Management** is about coping with complexity
- **Leadership** is about dealing with change

Different roles requiring different skills and focus

---

### Learning Organizations (Section 11.3)

**Leader's Role:**
- Building a learning organization where people continually learn
- Creating leadership skills and roles within the learning organization
- Allowing individuals to challenge mental models that exist within the organization

**Importance:**
- Complex learning requires the ability to challenge existing mental models
- Speed of organizational learning can be source of sustainable competitive advantage

---

### Emotional Intelligence (Section 11.4)

**Key Finding:**
- Emotional intelligence is a better predictor of the success of a leader than either IQ or technical skills
- Impact of emotional intelligence on effective leadership and company performance

**Implication:**
- Technical competence alone is insufficient for effective leadership
- Self-awareness, empathy, and interpersonal skills matter greatly

---

### Narcissistic Leaders (Section 11.5)

**Benefits of Narcissistic Leaders:**
- May actually be beneficial in turbulent markets
- Can provide bold vision and decisive action

**Dangers of Narcissistic Leaders:**
- Can be destructive to organizations
- May not listen to others or accept criticism
 
**Key Question:**
- Whether leadership capabilities can transpose from one organizational setting to another

**Suggestions:**
- Ways to help narcissists remain productive while minimizing negative impacts

---

### Vision, Values, and Culture (Section 11.6)

**Leader's Role:**
- Developing an organization's shared vision
- Shaping its values
- Building its culture

**Connection to Chapter 10:**
- Links to discussion of visionary companies and what makes organizations "great"

**National Culture:**
- Impact of national cultures on domestic organizations
- How understanding of culture can benefit leaders of multinational corporations
- Importance for different leadership approaches

---

### Directing Strategic Change (Section 11.7)

**Leadership Skills Required:**
- Specific skills necessary for directing strategic change
- Given complexity and uncertainty surrounding most organizations

**Obstacles to Change:**
- Various barriers to implementing change effectively
- Leadership skills necessary to overcome them

**Theory E and Theory O:**

| Theory E | Theory O |
|----------|----------|
| Economic value focus | Organizational capability focus |
| Top-down driven | Participative |
| Focus on structures and systems | Focus on culture |
| Shareholder value emphasis | Employee development emphasis |

**Key Insight:** Importance of successfully combining BOTH Theory E and Theory O to simultaneously achieve:
- Lasting change
- Increase in shareholder value

---

### Chaos Theory (Section 11.8)

**Application to Leadership:**
- How understanding of chaos may help leaders bring about innovation and strategic direction
- Implications for long-term plans and visions

**Key Insight:**
- In complex, unpredictable environments, traditional linear planning may be insufficient
- Leaders need to embrace uncertainty and enable emergent strategies

---

## Summary: Integration of Chapters 10 & 11

**The Strategy Implementation Challenge:**
1. **Structure matters but isn't enough** (Ch 10) - Matrix structures failed; need focus on processes
2. **Control systems must balance** accountability with innovation freedom
3. **Change can be evolutionary or revolutionary** - Greiner's model helps understand growth challenges
4. **Leadership is distinct from management** (Ch 11) - Change vs complexity
5. **Emotional intelligence > IQ** for leadership effectiveness
6. **Combine Theory E + Theory O** for lasting strategic change

**Key Tensions:**
- Specialization vs Coordination (structure)
- Control vs Innovation (control systems)
- Evolutionary vs Revolutionary (change)
- Management vs Leadership (roles)
- Theory E vs Theory O (change approach)

**The Human Element Throughout:**
- Ultimately individuals implement strategy
- They must accept the rationale for change
- Leaders must empower and create culture that enables this

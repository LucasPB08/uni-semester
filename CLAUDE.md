# Q3 Preparation Plan

## Context
- **Q3 Load**: 5 courses total (2 minor + 3 CS electives)
- **Minor courses**: Strategy (20% group work), Corporate Finance (NO group work - 100% exam)
- **Chosen Electives**: Functional Programming, Computer Security, Collaborative AI
- **Timeline**: Q2 runs Nov 8 → mid-Jan (exam), Q3 minor starts late Jan, Q3 electives start mid-Feb
- **Q3 Group Work**: 3 confirmed group projects (Strategy 20%, Security 20%, Collab AI 50%) + FP project TBD
- **Q2 Current Load**: Data Analytics minor (manageable with CS background)

## Elective Selection Decision (FINALIZED)

**Selected Courses:**
1. **Functional Programming (CSE3100)** - Theory-heavy but highly preparable, project nature unclear (may be individual)
2. **Computer Security (CSE3220)** - Applied/practical, 20% group work, highly preparable
3. **Collaborative AI (CSE3210)** - Moderate theory, 50% group work

## Q2 Preparation Strategy - FINALIZED

**Decision:** Prepare 3 courses during Q2 (Nov 8 → mid-Jan)

**Courses to prepare:**
1. **Corporate Finance** - Primary focus (flashcards + practice problems)
2. **Strategy** - Secondary focus (flashcards + case reading)
3. **Functional Programming** - Sustained practice (Haskell coding, no flashcards)

**NOT preparing in Q2:**
- Computer Security (defer to Q3 - only 20% group work, practical/broad topics manageable in Q3)
- Collaborative AI (defer to Q3 - 50% group work, limited prep value)

**Rationale:**
- **Timeline alignment**: Both minors start late January (before electives in mid-Feb)
- **Exam weight optimization**: Preparing for 100% + 70% + 65% = 235% exam weight
- **Flashcard suitability**: Corp Finance and Strategy are excellent for flashcard-based retention
- **Paradigm shift**: Functional Programming benefits from sustained Q2 exposure
- **Q2 bandwidth**: Data Analytics ongoing but manageable, allows prep of 3 courses
- **ROI maximization**: Corp Finance is 100% exam (highest individual ROI)

## Q2 Preparation Execution Plan

### 1. Acquire Course Materials (PRIORITY)

**Must acquire:**
- [ ] **Corporate Finance**: Brealey, Myers, Marcus - "Fundamentals of Corporate Finance" (McGraw-Hill)
- [ ] **Strategy**: Anthony Henry - "Understanding Strategic Management", 4th Edition (Oxford, 2021)
- [ ] **Functional Programming**: Graham Hutton - "Programming in Haskell", 2nd Edition

**Optional/later:**
- Computer Security materials (defer to Q3)
- Collaborative AI readings (defer to Q3)

### 2. Course-Specific Preparation Approaches

#### Corporate Finance (Primary Focus - Flashcard Heavy)
**Preparation method:**
- Read Brealey textbook systematically (chapters on investment analysis, valuation, capital structure)
- Create flashcards for:
  - Financial formulas (NPV, IRR, WACC, CAPM, etc.)
  - Financial ratios and their interpretations
  - Valuation methods and concepts
  - Capital structure theories (Modigliani-Miller, trade-off theory, pecking order)
  - Agency theory and information asymmetry concepts
  - Key definitions (present value, beta, cost of capital, etc.)
- Practice problems:
  - End-of-chapter exercises
  - Case study calculations
  - Valuation problems
- Review 3x/week with spaced repetition

**Target:** Complete first 50-60% of textbook during Q2

#### Strategy (Secondary Focus - Flashcard Heavy)
**Preparation method:**
- Read Anthony Henry textbook (focus on core frameworks)
- Create flashcards for:
  - Porter's Five Forces (definition + each force)
  - SWOT analysis components
  - Resource-based view concepts (VRIN framework)
  - Generic strategies (cost leadership, differentiation, focus)
  - Business-level vs corporate-level strategies
  - Strategic leadership principles
  - Key strategic management definitions
- Read sample Harvard cases:
  - Focus on understanding case analysis methodology
  - Practice applying frameworks to cases
  - Note common case structures
- Review 3x/week with spaced repetition

**Target:** Complete core strategic frameworks + 3-5 sample case analyses during Q2

#### Functional Programming (Sustained Practice - No Flashcards)
**Preparation method:**
- Install Haskell (GHC) on local machine
- Work through Hutton textbook chapters 1-8:
  - Chapter 1: Introduction
  - Chapter 2: First steps
  - Chapter 3: Types and classes
  - Chapter 4: Defining functions
  - Chapter 5: List comprehensions
  - Chapter 6: Recursive functions
  - Chapter 7: Higher-order functions
  - Chapter 8: Declaring types and classes
- Complete end-of-chapter exercises
- Focus on:
  - Understanding functional thinking (immutability, pure functions)
  - Pattern matching and recursion
  - Higher-order functions (map, filter, fold)
  - Type system and type inference
- Code regularly (at least 2x/week) to build muscle memory
- NO flashcards - this is about doing, not memorizing

**Target:** Comfortable with basic Haskell syntax and functional paradigm by end of Q2

### 3. Weekly Schedule (10 weeks: Nov 8 → mid-Jan)

**Weeks 1-4: Foundation Building**
- **Corporate Finance**: 40% of prep time (primary focus)
- **Strategy**: 30% of prep time
- **Functional Programming**: 30% of prep time
- **Data Analytics**: Ongoing Q2 course

**Weeks 5-8: Sustained Progress**
- **Corporate Finance**: 35% of prep time
- **Strategy**: 30% of prep time
- **Functional Programming**: 35% of prep time
- **Data Analytics**: Ongoing Q2 course + potential exam prep

**Weeks 9-10: Review & Q2 Exam Prep**
- **Corporate Finance**: Review flashcards, practice problems
- **Strategy**: Review flashcards, final case readings
- **Functional Programming**: Code practice, review key concepts
- **Data Analytics**: Exam preparation (priority)

### 4. Flashcard Strategy

**Creation:**
- Create cards immediately as you learn new concepts
- Use spaced repetition app (Anki recommended)
- Keep cards atomic (one concept per card)
- Include examples on cards where relevant

**Review:**
- Minimum 3x/week for Corp Finance and Strategy decks
- Daily reviews take 10-20 minutes once deck is established
- Front-load card creation in weeks 1-4

**Flashcard breakdown:**
- **Corporate Finance**: Estimated 100-150 cards
- **Strategy**: Estimated 60-80 cards
- **Functional Programming**: 0 cards (practice-based)

### 5. Success Metrics

**By mid-January, you should:**
- [ ] Be able to calculate NPV, IRR, WACC without looking up formulas
- [ ] Explain all components of Porter's Five Forces from memory
- [ ] Write simple Haskell functions using recursion and higher-order functions
- [ ] Have 150+ flashcards created and in active review rotation
- [ ] Feel confident about Corporate Finance concepts (100% exam = huge Q3 advantage)
- [ ] Understand Harvard case analysis methodology

**Benefits entering Q3:**
- Minors start late Jan - you'll be 6-8 weeks ahead on Corp Finance and Strategy
- Electives start mid-Feb - you'll have functional programming foundation
- Reduced panic when 3-4 group projects overlap
- More bandwidth to focus on group coordination vs learning fundamentals

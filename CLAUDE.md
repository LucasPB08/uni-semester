# Q3 Preparation Plan

## Context
- **Q3 Load**: 5 courses total (2 minor + 3 CS electives)
- **Minor courses**: Strategy (20% group work), Corporate Finance (NO group work - 100% exam)
- **Chosen Electives**: Functional Programming, Computer Security, Collaborative AI
- **Timeline**: Q2 runs Nov 8 → mid-Jan (exam), Q3 minor starts late Jan, Q3 electives start mid-Feb
- **Q3 Group Work**: 3 confirmed group projects (Strategy 20%, Security 20%, Collab AI 50%) + FP project TBD
- **Q2 Current Load**: Data Analytics minor (manageable with CS background)

## Elective Selection Decision (FINALIZED)

**Selected Courses:**
1. **Functional Programming (CSE3100)** - Programming-heavy but highly preparable, project nature unclear (may be individual)
2. **Computer Security (CSE3220)** - Applied/practical, 20% group work, highly preparable
3. **Collaborative AI (CSE3210)** - Moderate theory, 50% group work

## Q2 Preparation Strategy - FINALIZED

**Decision:** Prepare 3 courses during Q2 (Nov 8 → mid-Jan)

**Courses to prepare:**
1. **Corporate Finance** - Primary focus (flashcards + practice problems)
2. **Strategy** - Secondary focus (flashcards + case reading)
3. **Functional Programming** - Sustained practice (Haskell and Agda coding, no flashcards)

## Q2 Preparation Execution Plan

### 1. Acquire Course Materials (PRIORITY)

**Must acquire:**
- [ ] **Corporate Finance**: Brealey, Myers, Marcus - "Fundamentals of Corporate Finance" (McGraw-Hill)
- [ ] **Strategy**: Anthony Henry - "Understanding Strategic Management", 4th Edition (Oxford, 2021)
- [ ] **Functional Programming**: Graham Hutton - "Programming in Haskell", 2nd Edition

**Optional/later:**
- Computer Security materials (defer to Q3)
- Collaborative AI readings (defer to Q3)

### 2. Course-Specific Preparation Approaches

#### Corporate Finance (Flashcard Heavy)
**Preparation method:**
- Create flashcards
- Practice problems
- Review 3x/week with spaced repetition


#### Strategy (Flashcard Heavy)
**Preparation method:**
- Create flashcards
- Review 3x/week with spaced repetition

#### Functional Programming (Sustained Practice - No Flashcards)
**Preparation method:**
- Install Haskell (GHC) and Agda on local machine
- Focus on:
  - Understanding functional thinking (immutability, pure functions)
  - Pattern matching and recursion
  - Higher-order functions (map, filter, fold)
  - Type system and type inference
- Code regularly (at least 2x/week) to build muscle memory
- NO flashcards - this is about doing, not memorizing

**Target:** Comfortable with Haskell syntax and functional paradigm by end of Q2, same for Agda

### 3. Weekly Schedule (10 weeks: Nov 8 → mid-Jan)

### 4. Flashcard Strategy

**Creation:**
- Create cards immediately as you learn new concepts
- Use spaced repetition app, we will use Quizlet
- Keep cards atomic (one concept per card)
- Include examples on cards where relevant

**Review:**
- Minimum 3x/week for Corp Finance and Strategy decks
- Daily reviews take 10-20 minutes once deck is established
- Front-load card creation in weeks 1-4

### 5. Success Metrics

**Benefits entering Q3:**
- Minors start late Jan - you'll be 6-8 weeks ahead on Corp Finance and Strategy
- Electives start mid-Feb - you'll have functional programming foundation
- Reduced panic when 3-4 group projects overlap
- More bandwidth to focus on group coordination vs learning fundamentals

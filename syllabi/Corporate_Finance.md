## 1. Introduction to Finance and Accounting

### 1.1 Finance: Flow Variables

The function of a company in the societal production process is to propel resources through the business column; here, input is transformed into output. Physical flows run through the company.

**Physical Flow Model:**
```
Input => Company => Output
```

**Financial Flow Model:**
```
Expenses <= Company <= Receivables
Input => Company => Output
```

**Complete Model with Capital Markets:**
```
                Capital markets
        Cash in ↓           ↑ Cash out
Expenses <= Assets Company <= Receivables
Input => Capital employed => Output
```

### Key Concepts

- **Costs**: Sacrificed values (resources consumed)
- **Revenues**: Obtained values (output sold)
- **Profit**: Difference between revenues and costs

### Time Difference Problem

"Cost precedes revenue" - Companies must first acquire and pay for resources before production and sales generate receipts. This time difference can be bridged through:

1. Holding cash
2. Bank credit, loans, or shareholder money
3. Supplier credit (accounts payable)

### Capital Types

- **Equity**: Capital from owners (risk-bearing capital)
- **Debt**: Capital from third parties (risk-averse capital)

### 1.2 Accounting: Flow and Stock Variables

**Flow Variables** (period variables):
- Number of units per period
- Examples: purchases, sales, costs, revenues

**Stock Variables** (point-in-time variables):
- Number of units at a specific point in time
- Examples: inventory, cash, receivables, payables

### The Three Financial Statements

1. **Cash Flow Statement**: Receipts and expenditures (financial flows)
2. **Profit and Loss Statement**: Revenues and expenses (physical flows)
3. **Balance Sheet**: Inventory of assets, equity, and liabilities (stocks)

### Value Conversion Model Elements

- Financial flows
- Physical flows
- Financial stocks
- Physical stocks

## 2. The Balance Sheet, P&L Statement, and Cash Flow Statement

### 2.1 Introduction

The balance sheet, profit and loss statement, and cash flow statement provide insight into:
- **Balance Sheet**: Financial position at a specific moment
- **P&L Statement**: Change in equity due to profit (over a period)
- **Cash Flow Statement**: Change in cash position (over a period)

### 2.2 The Balance Sheet

**Balance Sheet Equation:**
```
Assets (A) = Equity (EQ) + Liabilities (L)
```

Or equivalently:
```
Equity (EQ) = Assets (A) - Liabilities (L)
```

#### Balance Sheet Structure

**Assets (Debit Side)** - Resources:
- Fixed Assets (> 1 year use)
  - Buildings
  - Machinery
  - Equipment
- Current Assets (< 1 year use)
  - Inventory
  - Accounts Receivable
  - Cash

**Liabilities (Credit Side)** - Capital:
- Equity (permanent, risk-bearing)
- Long-term Debt (> 1 year)
  - Mortgage loans
  - Bond loans
- Short-term Debt (< 1 year)
  - Bank overdraft
  - Accounts payable
  - Rent payable

#### Example Balance Sheet

| **Assets** | | **Liabilities** | |
|------------|---------|-----------------|---------|
| Building | €100,000 | Equity | €20,000 |
| | | Mortgage | €80,000 |
| **Total Assets** | **€100,000** | **Total Liabilities** | **€100,000** |

### 2.3 The Profit and Loss Statement

The P&L statement includes costs and revenues of a specific period, showing the difference as profit or loss.

#### Horizontal Format

| **Costs (Debit)** | | **Revenues (Credit)** | |
|-------------------|---------|---------------------|---------|
| Cost of Goods Sold | €135,000 | Revenue | €160,000 |
| Depreciation | €5,000 | | |
| **Profit** | **€20,000** | | |
| **Total** | **€160,000** | **Total** | **€160,000** |

#### Vertical Format

```
Revenue                          €160,000
- Cost of Goods Sold            -€135,000
- Depreciation                    -€5,000
─────────────────────────────────────────
Net Profit                        €20,000
```

### 2.4 Cash Flow Statement

The cash flow statement tracks receipts and payments, categorized into three activities:

#### 1. Operating Cash Flow
- Receipts from customers
- Payments to suppliers
- Payments to employees
- Interest and dividend payments
- Tax payments

#### 2. Investing Cash Flow
- Investments (purchases of fixed assets)
- Disinvestments (sales of fixed assets)

#### 3. Financing Cash Flow
- Loans received
- Loans repaid
- Share issues
- Dividends paid

#### Direct vs. Indirect Method

**Direct Method**: Lists actual cash receipts and payments

**Indirect Method**: Reconciles profit to cash flow
```
Cash Flow = Profit + Depreciation + Working Capital Changes
```

## 3. Finance Theory and Financial Structure

### 3.1 Introduction

Companies need to determine:
1. **Capital requirements** (investment decision)
2. **How to meet these needs** (financing decision)

### 3.2 Forms of Capital

#### 3.2.1 Equity Capital

**Functions of Equity:**
1. Financing company activities
2. Risk-bearing (entrepreneurial function)
3. Guarantee/buffer for absorbing losses
4. No repayment obligation (permanent capital)

**Components of Equity (for NV - Public Limited Company):**

1. **Share Capital**
   - Authorized Capital: Maximum shares that can be issued
   - Issued Capital: Shares actually sold to shareholders
   - Paid-up Capital: Amount actually paid by shareholders

2. **Reserves**
   - Retained earnings
   - Legal reserves
   - Statutory reserves

3. **Undistributed Profit**
   - Current year profit before distribution

**Types of Shares:**
- Ordinary shares
- Preference shares
- Cumulative preference shares
- Convertible preference shares
- Share certificates

#### Share Characteristics

1. **Financial Aspect**: Tradable security with market value
2. **Reward Aspect**: Dividends and stock appreciation
3. **Governance Aspect**: Voting rights in general assembly

#### Profit Distribution Process

**Two Phases:**
1. **Profit Determination**: Prepare income statement
2. **Profit Allocation**: Distribute as dividend or add to reserves

**Example Profit Distribution:**
```
Undistributed Profit                €20,000
- Dividend (75 × €100)              -€7,500
- Retained Earnings                +€12,500
```

**Pay-out Ratio** = Dividend / Profit = €7,500 / €20,000 = 37.5%

#### 3.2.2 Debt Capital

**Classification:**
a. Provisions (self-created obligations for future risks)
b. Long-term loans (> 1 year)
c. Short-term loans (< 1 year)

**Key Loan Conditions:**
1. Interest rate
2. Term
3. Collateral/securities

**Types of Long-term Debt:**
- **Bond Loan**: Fragmented loan, may be listed on stock exchange
  - Face value (principal)
  - Maturity date
  - Interest rate
  - Potential securities
  - Types: subordinated bonds, convertible bonds

- **Private Loan**: Customized contract with financial institution
  - Lower issuance costs
  - Less liquid than bonds
  - May be subordinated
  - Can be securitized later

**Types of Short-term Debt:**
- **Revolving Credit Facility**: Bank overdraft up to a limit
- **Accounts Payable**: Credit from suppliers
- **Taxes**: Corporate tax, sales tax
- **Dividends**: After profit distribution proposal
- **Accrued Items**: Outstanding payments (e.g., rent)

## 4. Risk: General, Operational and Financial

### 4.1 Introduction

**Two Types of Company-Level Risk:**
1. **Operational Risk**: Related to cost structure (debit side of balance sheet)
2. **Financial Risk**: Related to capital structure (credit side of balance sheet)

### 4.2 Cost Theory

#### 4.2.1 Cost Types

**Categories:**
- Costs of land
- Raw materials and supplies
- Labor costs
- Durable production resources (depreciation)
- Services from third parties
- Taxes
- Interest

**Important Notes:**
- **Depreciation**: Spreading expense of durable assets over their useful life
- **Taxes**: Cost-increasing taxes (property, vehicle, environmental) vs. profit taxes
- **VAT**: Not a cost; collected on behalf of government
- **Interest**: Economic cost whether using debt or equity (opportunity cost)

#### 4.2.2 Cost Classifications

**1. By Function (Organic Classification):**
- Production costs
- Management costs
- Sales costs
- Procurement costs
- Administrative costs

**2. Direct vs. Indirect Costs:**
- **Direct Costs**: Traceable to specific product (e.g., raw materials)
- **Indirect Costs (Overhead)**: Not traceable to single product (e.g., rent, management salaries)

**3. Fixed vs. Variable Costs:**
- **Fixed Costs**: Don't change with production volume (within certain limits)
  - Examples: rent, depreciation, administrative costs, management salaries
  - Also called: capacity costs or period costs
  - Average fixed costs decrease as production increases

- **Variable Costs**: Change directly with production volume
  - Examples: raw materials, electricity for production
  - Also called: production costs
  - Variable costs per unit remain constant

### 4.3 Break-even Analysis

**Contribution Margin** = Selling Price - Variable Costs per unit

**Break-even Point Formula:**
```
Break-even Point = Fixed Costs / Contribution Margin per unit
```

**Example:**
- Fixed costs: €150,000
- Variable costs per unit: €2.50
- Selling price: €10.00
- Contribution margin: €10.00 - €2.50 = €7.50

```
Break-even Point = €150,000 / €7.50 = 20,000 units
Break-even Revenue = 20,000 × €10 = €200,000
```

**Verification:**
```
Revenue (20,000 × €10)           €200,000
Fixed Costs                     -€150,000
Variable Costs (20,000 × €2.50)  -€50,000
────────────────────────────────────────
Profit                                €0
```

#### Break-even Graph Zones

1. **Revenue < Costs**: Loss zone (left of break-even point)
2. **Revenue = Costs**: Break-even point
3. **Revenue > Costs**: Profit zone (right of break-even point)

### 4.4 Operational Risk

**Operational Risk** depends on the cost structure:
- Higher fixed costs → Higher operational risk
- Higher variable costs → Lower operational risk

**Operational Leverage:**
- Companies with high fixed costs are more sensitive to sales fluctuations
- Both positive and negative effects amplified

**Example: Impact of Operational Leverage**

*Scenario 1: 50% Variable Costs, €100,000 Fixed Costs*

| Revenue | €200,000 | €300,000 | €400,000 |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| Var. Costs (50%) | €100,000 | €150,000 | €200,000 |
| Contribution Margin | €100,000 | €150,000 | €200,000 |
| Fixed Costs | €100,000 | €100,000 | €100,000 |
| **Earnings** | **€0** | **€50,000** | **€100,000** |

*Scenario 2: 40% Variable Costs, €130,000 Fixed Costs*

| Revenue | €200,000 | €300,000 | €400,000 |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| Var. Costs (40%) | €80,000 | €120,000 | €160,000 |
| Contribution Margin | €120,000 | €180,000 | €240,000 |
| Fixed Costs | €130,000 | €130,000 | €130,000 |
| **Earnings** | **-€10,000** | **€50,000** | **€110,000** |

**Observation:** Scenario 2 (higher operational leverage) shows:
- Greater sensitivity to revenue changes
- Higher risk (larger spread in results)
- Higher potential rewards when revenue is high

**Reducing Operational Risk:**
- Outsourcing (converting fixed costs to variable)
- Using payroll companies
- Making cost structure more flexible

## 5. Financial Risks

### 5.1 Introduction

Ratios help assess:
- **Risk**: Likelihood of company defaulting
- **Return**: Performance achieved

**Trade-off:** Risk and return are interconnected - higher risk requires higher return.

### 5.2 Ratios

#### 5.2.1 Three Categories of Ratios

1. **Solvency Ratios**: Long-term debt obligations
2. **Liquidity Ratios**: Short-term payment ability
3. **Profitability Ratios**: Performance and returns

### 5.2.2 Solvency Ratios

**Solvency** = Ability to meet long-term debt obligations

**Solvency Ratio:**
```
Solvency Ratio = (Equity / Total Assets) × 100%
```

**Example:**
```
Solvency = €1,850,000 / €5,000,000 × 100% = 37%
```

**Typical Range:** 25% - 40% for large Dutch companies

**Why Equity Enhances Solvency:**
1. No repayment obligation
2. No fixed dividend payments required
3. Provides buffer to absorb losses
4. Priority in bankruptcy goes to debt holders
5. Increases asset coverage value per euro of debt

### 5.2.3 Liquidity Ratios

**Liquidity** = Ability to pay short-term obligations promptly

**Current Ratio:**
```
Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
```

**Quick Ratio (Acid Test):**
```
Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
```

**Example:**
```
Current Assets = €960,000 + €570,000 + €25,000 = €1,555,000
Current Liabilities = €260,000 + €120,000 + €650,000 = €1,030,000

Current Ratio = €1,555,000 / €1,030,000 = 1.51
Quick Ratio = €595,000 / €1,030,000 = 0.58
```

**Common Norms** (use with caution):
- Minimum Current Ratio: 2.0
- Minimum Quick Ratio: 1.0

**Net Working Capital:**
```
Net Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
```

#### Vertical Balance Sheet Format

| **Fixed Assets** | €3,445,000 |
| **Current Assets** | €1,555,000 |
| **Current Liabilities** | -€1,030,000 |
| **Net Working Capital** | **€525,000** |
| **Capital Employed** | **€3,970,000** |
| | |
| **Equity** | €1,850,000 |
| **Long-term Debt** | €2,120,000 |
| **Funds Employed** | **€3,970,000** |

### 5.2.4 Financial Risk

**Financial Leverage Effect:**

Companies can enhance return on equity by using debt (if return on assets > interest rate).

**Example:**
- Return on Total Assets (RTA) = 10%
- Interest on Debt = 8%
- Financing: 80% equity, 20% debt

```
EBIT                            €20,000
Interest (8% × €40,000)         -€3,200
Net Profit                      €16,800
Equity                         €160,000

ROE = €16,800 / €160,000 = 10.5%
```

vs. 100% equity financing:
```
ROE = €20,000 / €200,000 = 10%
```

**But... Higher debt also increases risk!**

**Example: Impact of Financial Leverage on Risk**

*100% Equity Financing:*

| EBIT | €0 | €10,000 | €20,000 | €30,000 | €40,000 |
|------|-----|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Interest | €0 | €0 | €0 | €0 | €0 |
| Net Profit | €0 | €10,000 | €20,000 | €30,000 | €40,000 |
| Equity | €200,000 | €200,000 | €200,000 | €200,000 | €200,000 |
| **ROE** | **0%** | **5%** | **10%** | **15%** | **20%** |

*80% Equity, 20% Debt Financing:*

| EBIT | €0 | €10,000 | €20,000 | €30,000 | €40,000 |
|------|-----|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Interest | €3,200 | €3,200 | €3,200 | €3,200 | €3,200 |
| Net Profit | -€3,200 | €6,800 | €16,800 | €26,800 | €36,800 |
| Equity | €160,000 | €160,000 | €160,000 | €160,000 | €160,000 |
| **ROE** | **-2.0%** | **4.3%** | **10.5%** | **16.8%** | **23.0%** |

**Observation:** Higher debt financing creates:
- Greater spread in ROE (higher risk)
- Higher potential returns when EBIT is high
- Potential losses when EBIT is low

## 6. Agency Theory and Information Asymmetry

### 6.1 Introduction

**Central Question:** Why do enterprises exist?

**Enterprise Theories:**
1. Transaction Cost Theory
2. Agency Theory
3. Information Asymmetry Theory

### 6.2 Enterprise Theories

#### Transaction Cost Theory (Coase)

**Main Idea:** Enterprises exist because using the market has costs.

**Transaction Costs Include:**
- Finding relevant prices
- Price comparison
- Assessing product quality
- Negotiation costs
- Drafting and concluding contracts
- Monitoring compliance

**Key Insight:** Enterprises coordinate activities when it's cheaper than using the market mechanism.

#### Team Production and Monitoring

**Problem:** In team production, output > sum of individual outputs, but:
- Individual contributions hard to measure
- Workers may shirk (reduce effort)

**Solution:** Appoint a monitor (manager) who:
- Monitors employees
- Receives share of team output (residual claimant)
- Has incentive to ensure optimal effort

### 6.3 Agency Theory

**Key Players:**
- **Principal**: Assigner (e.g., employer, shareholder)
- **Agent**: Executor (e.g., employee, manager)

**Core Problem:** Agent has information advantage over principal

#### Types of Agency Problems

**1. Moral Hazard (Ex Post)**
- Agent changes behavior after contract signed
- Example: Insured person takes less care of property
- Solutions:
  - Monitoring
  - Deductibles
  - Delayed payouts
  - Tedious claim forms

**2. Adverse Selection (Ex Ante)**
- Agent has information advantage before contract
- Example: Insurance applicant knows health better than insurer
- Solutions:
  - **Screening**: Principal gathers information (e.g., medical exam)
  - **Signaling**: Agent demonstrates quality (e.g., diplomas)

#### Agency Costs

**Three Components:**
1. **Monitoring Costs**: Principal's costs to observe agent
2. **Bonding Costs**: Agent's costs to demonstrate trustworthiness
3. **Residual Loss**: Remaining loss from information asymmetry

**Objective:** Minimize total agency costs

#### Applications in Finance

**1. Shareholder vs. Manager Conflict**

Manager may pursue own interests:
- Low effort level
- Lavish expenses
- Risk avoidance
- Short-term focus

**Solutions:**
- Monitoring (Supervisory Board)
- Transparency (annual reports)
- Align compensation (stock options)
- Reputation building

**2. Shareholder vs. Bondholder Conflict**

**Three Agency Cost Types:**

a) **Incentive Effects**
   - Bondholders receive fixed return
   - Shareholders have incentive to increase risk after loan agreement
   - Value shifts from bondholders to shareholders

b) **Monitoring and Bonding Costs**
   - Including covenants in loan agreements
   - Monitoring compliance
   - Reporting requirements

c) **Bankruptcy and Restructuring Costs**
   - Direct costs: legal and administrative
   - Indirect costs: lost opportunities, customer/supplier reactions

### 6.4 The Microeconomic Finance Theory

#### Modigliani-Miller Proposition

**Main Result:** In perfect capital markets, capital structure is irrelevant to firm value.

**Key Assumptions:**
- Perfect capital markets
- No taxes
- No bankruptcy costs
- No information asymmetry

**Logic:**
- Total cash flow from assets remains constant
- Method of dividing cash flow (equity vs. debt) doesn't add value
- Weighted average cost of capital remains the same

**Example:**
```
50% Equity (10% required return) + 50% Debt (5% interest)
Weighted Average = 0.5 × 10% + 0.5 × 5% = 7.5%

If shift to 20% Equity + 80% Debt:
- Debt becomes riskier, required return increases to ~6.25%
- Equity becomes riskier, required return increases
- Weighted average still ≈ 7.5%
```

#### Market Imperfections

**Real-world factors that matter:**

1. **Taxes**
   - Interest on debt is tax-deductible
   - Dividends are not
   - → Tax advantage for debt financing

2. **Bankruptcy Costs**
   - Direct: Legal and administrative costs
   - Indirect: Lost opportunities, damaged relationships
   - → Counterbalances tax advantage of debt

3. **Agency Costs**
   - Conflicts between stakeholders
   - Monitoring and bonding costs
   - → Affects optimal capital structure

#### Benefits of Debt Capital

1. **Market Discipline**: Management must regularly access capital market
2. **Reduced Free Cash Flow**: Fixed obligations prevent overinvestment
3. **Information Value**: Meeting payments signals minimum cash flow
4. **Monitoring Specialization**: Banks specialize in monitoring

#### Myers-Majluf Model (Information Asymmetry)

**Problem:** Management knows firm value better than market

**Consequence:**  - Share issuance signals overvaluation
- Good firms may forego positive NPV projects
- Value lost from unexploited growth options

**Solution - Pecking Order Theory:**
1. **First**: Internal capital (retained earnings)
2. **Second**: Debt (less sensitive to mispricing)
3. **Last**: Equity (most sensitive to mispricing)

**Implication:**
- Hold cash reserves for future investments
- Build debt capacity
- Avoid signaling through financing choices

# Q3 Course Analysis

## Minor Courses (Mandatory)

### 1. Strategy (Campus The Hague)

**What it's about:** This course covers the conceptual framework of strategic management and leadership in a turbulent business environment. It discusses the nature of strategy, strategic analysis prior to formulation, and implementation implications. Topics include the strategic management process, analyzing external and competitive environments, resource-based view of strategy, business-level and corporate-level strategies, and strategic leadership and corporate governance. The course uses the Harvard case method with practical exercises on international business cases, emphasizing how companies must constantly adapt to changing socio-cultural, political, technological, and economic trends.

**Team project:** Yes. Assessment includes 20% Group case analysis. Students must analyze cases weekly and submit a final version of the case analysis at the end of the course. The group case analysis and participation (10%) cannot be retested - only the exam (70%) has a resit option.

**Difficulty estimate:** Moderate. The course is conceptually rich but applied rather than mathematically intensive. Strategic management frameworks and models (Porter's Five Forces, SWOT, resource-based view) are well-established and learnable. The Harvard case method requires analytical thinking and the ability to apply frameworks to practical situations. Must achieve 5.0+ on the exam to pass. The group case analysis adds coordination requirements.

**Preparation ease:** Moderately high. The course uses "Understanding Strategic Management" by Anthony Henry (4th edition, Oxford University Press, 2021). You can read this textbook ahead of time and familiarize yourself with strategic management frameworks. However, 20% of the grade is locked in group case analysis during the quarter, and 10% is attendance/participation, so individual preparation has limited impact on those components. The conceptual nature makes it relatively straightforward to prepare independently.

**Structure:** 7 lectures (2 hours each) + 7 workgroups (2 hours each). Starts late January.

**Textbook:** Anthony Henry – Understanding Strategic Management, Oxford University Press, Fourth Edition, 2021. ISBN: 978-0-19-885983-3

### 2. Corporate Finance (Campus The Hague)

**What it's about:** This course focuses on the use and acquisition of capital, covering investment and financing decisions from accounting and finance perspectives. Topics include financial arithmetic and market value, balance sheets and cash flow statements, investment analysis using cash flows and return calculations, valuation of shares and companies, agency theory and information asymmetry in financing, operational and financial risk, capital costs and capital structure, and integrating finance with strategy and marketing. The course emphasizes understanding different dimensions of value and solving investment/financing issues with numerical underpinnings while maintaining conceptual understanding.

**Team project:** No. Assessment is 100% written exam - no group work at all. This is the only course in your Q3 load with zero group work component.

**Difficulty estimate:** Moderate to moderately high. Finance concepts involve calculations and quantitative analysis, requiring comfort with financial arithmetic, present value calculations, and risk/return relationships. The course integrates accounting and finance perspectives, requiring understanding of both. Students must prepare cases for seminars or risk removal from workgroups, indicating active participation expectations. However, the 100% exam format means you can focus entirely on mastering the material without group coordination overhead.

**Preparation ease:** Very high. The course uses "Fundamentals of Corporate Finance" by Brealey, Myers, Marcus (McGraw-Hill). Since it's 100% exam-based, individual preparation has maximum impact. Finance and accounting concepts are well-documented with abundant resources. You can read the textbook, practice calculations, study valuation methods, and work through case examples independently. The clear textbook and exam-only format make this the most preparable course in your Q3 load.

**Structure:** 7 lectures (2 hours each) + 7 seminars (2 hours each). Starts late January.

**Textbook:** Brealey, R.A., S.C. Myers, A.J. Marcus, Fundamentals of Corporate Finance, McGraw-Hill (specific edition will be announced on Brightspace)

**Additional resources:** Workbook on Brightspace covering technical matters

## CS Electives (Chosen)

### 3. Functional Programming (CSE3100)

**What it's about:** This course teaches purely functional programming through two languages: Haskell and Agda. The first half focuses on Haskell, covering functions as first-class data, algebraic datatypes, pattern matching, recursion, lazy evaluation, monads, and property-based testing with QuickCheck. The second half introduces Agda, a language with dependent types, covering the Curry-Howard correspondence, indexed datatypes, dependent pattern matching, and formal verification through equational reasoning. The emphasis is on writing programs where functions have no side effects and types guarantee correctness.

**Team project:** The course includes "a large project to be implemented in Haskell" worth 35% of the grade, though the studyguide doesn't explicitly state whether it's individual or group work. The assessment structure suggests it might be individual, but this needs confirmation.

**Difficulty estimate:** High. This is a paradigm shift from imperative/OOP programming, requiring you to think about computation in an entirely different way. Learning Haskell's lazy evaluation, monads, and type classes is challenging enough, but adding Agda's dependent types and formal verification makes it conceptually demanding. The requirement for "Concepts of Programming Languages" (CSE2120) as prior knowledge indicates significant theoretical depth. Both the project and exam require 5.0+ to pass, with a final grade of 5.8+.

**Preparation ease:** Relatively straightforward to prepare. The course uses "Programming in Haskell (2nd edition)" by Graham Hutton, which you can start reading during Q2. Since the concepts are so different from typical programming, early exposure would be highly beneficial. Working through the first few chapters and getting comfortable with functional thinking would give you a significant advantage. The theoretical nature means you can study independently without needing access to course-specific tools or frameworks. Haskell can be installed and practiced on your own machine.

**Structure:** 2 instruction sessions per week (0/0/4/0 lecture) + 4 hours of exercise classes per week (0/0/4/0 shared lab). Starts mid-February.

**Textbook:**
- Programming in Haskell (2nd edition) by Graham Hutton
- Lecture notes "Introduction to Property-Based Testing with QuickCheck"
- Lecture notes "Programming and Proving in Agda"

**Assessment:** Course project (35%) + Final written exam (65%). Both parts must be 5.0+ and final grade must be 5.8+. Resit available for exam in Q4. Project resubmission available in Q4 (max grade 6.0).

### 4. Computer Security (CSE3220)

**What it's about:** This course provides a comprehensive introduction to computer security fundamentals across multiple domains. System Security covers operating system security, access control, authentication, authorization, database security, software security, and malware detection/prevention. Network Security includes secure protocols, network attacks and defenses, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and cyber threats. Applied Cryptography covers symmetric/asymmetric encryption, hash functions, digital signatures, certificates, key exchange, and web/cloud security. The course also includes selected advanced security topics.

**Team project:** Yes. Assessment includes 2 mandatory group assignments worth 10% each (20% total), plus an 80% final exam. The studyguide explicitly states "The assignments are mandatory and cannot be made individually." There's an alternative assignment option only for students with unforeseen difficulties approved 2 days before the deadline with study counselor documentation.

**Difficulty estimate:** Moderate. The breadth of topics (systems, networks, cryptography) means you'll cover a lot of ground, but individual concepts are generally practical and applied rather than deeply theoretical. Security is about understanding attack vectors and defense mechanisms, which are concrete and often intuitive once explained. The prerequisite is just "Computer Networks," suggesting it's not overly demanding. However, the breadth could make it challenging to master everything deeply. The mandatory group work adds coordination overhead. Both assignments combined and exam must be 5.0+ minimum (per TER).

**Preparation ease:** Relatively easy to prepare. Security topics are well-documented with abundant online resources, tutorials, and books. You could read about cryptographic primitives, common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10), network security basics, and authentication mechanisms. However, 20% of your grade is locked behind mandatory group assignments during the quarter, limiting the value of solo preparation for that component. The exam (80%) is heavily preparable.

**Structure:** 4 hours of lectures per week (0/0/4/0 lecture) + 4 hours of shared lab per week (0/0/4/0 shared lab). Starts mid-February.

**Assessment:** 2 group assignments (20% total, 10% each) + Final exam (80%). Minimum grade requirements per TER for both components. Resit available for exam. Alternative assignments possible with documentation for unforeseen difficulties.

**Prerequisites:** Computer Networks

### 5. Collaborative Artificial Intelligence (CSE3210)

**What it's about:** This course focuses on decentralized AI systems where multiple intelligent agents (humans and AI) interact, contrasting with traditional centralized AI approaches. Topics include co-active design of decentralized AI systems, automated negotiation among autonomous agents, agent communication and interaction protocols, and agent coordination mechanisms. The emphasis is on ethical AI concerns like fairness, accountability, transparency, and privacy, exploring how decentralized systems can address issues inherent in centralized data collection models.

**Team project:** Yes. The assessment is 50% Group Assignments and 50% Written Examination. Group assignments are mandatory and performed during the quarter. There's no resit option for the group work, only a repair option if you fail (maximum grade 6.0), which can be done solo. The written exam has one resit in the same academic year.

**Difficulty estimate:** Moderate. The concepts around multi-agent systems, negotiation theory, and coordination mechanisms are conceptually interesting but not as mathematically intensive as some CS courses. The challenge comes more from understanding agent interactions and applying co-active design principles. The heavy group work component adds organizational complexity and dependency on teammates' performance and availability. No specific knockout criteria mentioned beyond standard passing requirements.

**Preparation ease:** Moderate. You could read about multi-agent systems, game theory, and negotiation algorithms ahead of time. However, since 50% of your grade depends on group work that happens during the quarter, individual preparation has limited impact on that component. You can't complete group assignments solo beforehand, making this less amenable to front-running compared to theory-heavy courses. Focus preparation on the exam component (50%).

**Structure:** 4 hours of lectures per week (0/0/4/0 lecture) + 4 hours of shared lab per week (0/0/4/0 shared lab). Starts mid-February.

**Assessment:** Group Assignments (50%) + Written Examination (50%). Exam and assignments are both intermediate results that don't count separately for next academic year - only final grade remains. Specific grade calculation details provided in introductory lecture.

# Corporate Finance Course - Study Workflow

## Purpose
Extract key concepts from textbook chapters and generate both study notes and Quizlet flashcards for exam preparation.

## Workflow

**Approach Decision:**
- **Generate notes from standard corporate finance knowledge** (no textbook screenshots required)
- Rationale: Ch 3-14 cover standardized concepts (financial statements, valuation, NPV, WACC, etc.) that don't vary significantly between textbooks
- User reviews notes and flags any gaps, textbook-specific terminology, or professor emphases
- Benefits: Much faster, focused on exam-critical concepts, comprehensive coverage

**Each week:**
1. Agent creates structured notes based on standard corporate finance fundamentals → `week-X/notes.md`
2. **User reviews notes and provides feedback/approval** (flags gaps or textbook-specific content)
3. **ONLY AFTER notes are finalized:** Agent generates Quizlet-ready flashcards → `week-X/flashcards.md`
4. User copies flashcards to Quizlet for spaced repetition
5. Check off completed week below

## Note Structure

For each chapter/section, organize as:
- **Key Definitions** - Core terms to memorize (e.g., solvency, liquidity, equity)
- **Formulas** - Critical calculations with examples (e.g., break-even point, ratios)
- **Key Concepts** - Main ideas explained concisely (e.g., agency theory, capital structure)
- **Examples** - Numerical examples and scenarios (useful for problem-solving practice)

## Flashcard Guidelines

**IMPORTANT - Quantity:**
- Target: **15-20 flashcards per week**
- Variation: ±10 cards (acceptable range: 5-30 cards)
- Quality over quantity - focus on the most important concepts only

**Format - Quizlet Import Ready:**
- Use **tab character** to separate question and answer (for Quizlet import)
- One card per line
- Keep answers concise (1-3 lines maximum)
- Include formula cards with clear notation

**Example format:**
```
What is the solvency ratio formula?	Solvency Ratio = (Equity / Total Assets) × 100%
What are the three types of cash flows?	1) Operating Cash Flow, 2) Investing Cash Flow, 3) Financing Cash Flow
What is the break-even point formula?	Break-even Point = Fixed Costs / Contribution Margin per unit
What is financial leverage?	Using debt to enhance return on equity (if ROA > interest rate)
```

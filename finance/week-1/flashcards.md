Where does depreciation appear on the balance sheet?	Reduces Fixed Assets as "Accumulated Depreciation" (contra-asset account)
What is the formula for straight-line depreciation?	Annual Depreciation = (Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life
What is the difference between accrual and cash accounting?	Accrual records revenue when earned and expenses when incurred; Cash records only when cash changes hands
Where does inventory appear on financial statements?	Balance Sheet under Current Assets
What are the three sections of the Cash Flow Statement?	1) Operating Cash Flow, 2) Investing Cash Flow, 3) Financing Cash Flow
Why is depreciation added back when calculating operating cash flow?	It's a non-cash expense that reduced net income but didn't actually use cash
Does the company still have cash after recording non-cash expenses?	Yes - non-cash expenses (like depreciation) reduce accounting profit but don't involve cash leaving the company. The actual cash outflow happened when the asset was purchased.
What is the Current Ratio formula and what does it measure?	Current Assets / Current Liabilities; measures ability to pay short-term obligations
Where does interest expense appear on the Income Statement?	Between EBIT and EBT (after operating profit, before taxes)

What is the formula for Return on Equity (ROE)?	Net Income / Shareholders' Equity

Where do dividends paid appear on financial statements?	Cash Flow Statement under Financing Cash Flow (NOT on Income Statement)
What does the Quick Ratio exclude that Current Ratio includes?	Inventory (Quick Ratio is more conservative: excludes less liquid assets)
What is EBIT and how is it calculated?	Earnings Before Interest & Tax = Revenue - COGS - Operating Expenses
What does the Debt-to-Equity ratio measure?	Financial leverage; shows how much debt vs equity is used to finance assets (Total Debt / Equity)
Why can a company be profitable but have negative cash flow?	If working capital increases significantly (e.g., inventory buildup, slow receivables collection)
Where does equipment purchased with cash appear on the Cash Flow Statement?	Investing Cash Flow as a cash outflow (capital expenditure)
What is Free Cash Flow (FCF)?	Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures (cash available for investors after maintaining assets)
What does Interest Coverage Ratio measure and what's the formula?	Ability to pay interest on debt; EBIT / Interest Expense (higher = safer)

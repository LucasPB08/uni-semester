# Week 1 Notes: Chapters 3-4 - Financial Statements

## Chapter 3: Accounting and Finance

### Key Definitions

**Accounting Equation**
- **Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity**
- Fundamental principle: Everything a company owns is financed by either debt or equity

**Assets**
- Resources owned by the company with future economic value
- Current Assets: Cash, accounts receivable, inventory (converted to cash within 1 year)
- Fixed Assets (Non-current): Property, plant, equipment, intangible assets (used over multiple years)

**Liabilities**
- Obligations the company owes to others
- Current Liabilities: Accounts payable, short-term debt (due within 1 year)
- Long-term Liabilities: Long-term debt, bonds payable (due beyond 1 year)

**Shareholders' Equity (Book Value)**
- Owners' stake in the company = Assets - Liabilities
- Components: Common stock, retained earnings, additional paid-in capital

**Depreciation**
- Systematic allocation of asset cost over its useful life
- Methods: Straight-line (most common), declining balance, units of production
- **Straight-line formula**: Annual Depreciation = (Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life

**Accrual Accounting vs Cash Accounting**
- **Accrual**: Records revenue when earned and expenses when incurred (regardless of cash flow)
- **Cash**: Records transactions only when cash changes hands
- Corporate finance uses accrual accounting (matches GAAP/IFRS standards)

**Book Value vs Market Value**
- **Book Value**: Historical cost shown on balance sheet (accounting perspective)
- **Market Value**: Current market price of assets/company (economic perspective)
- Market value usually differs from book value (especially for publicly traded companies)

## Chapter 4: Measuring Corporate Performance

### The Three Financial Statements

#### 1. Balance Sheet (Statement of Financial Position)
**Purpose**: Snapshot of company's financial position at a specific point in time

**Structure**:
```
ASSETS                          LIABILITIES & EQUITY
Current Assets                  Current Liabilities
  Cash                            Accounts Payable
  Accounts Receivable             Short-term Debt
  Inventory
Fixed Assets                    Long-term Liabilities
  Property, Plant, Equipment      Long-term Debt
  (less: Accumulated Depreciation)
Intangible Assets              Shareholders' Equity
  Goodwill, Patents               Common Stock
                                  Retained Earnings
-------------------------------------------
Total Assets                  = Total Liabilities + Equity
```

#### 2. Income Statement (P&L - Profit & Loss Statement)
**Purpose**: Shows company's profitability over a period (quarter/year)

**Structure**:
```
Revenue (Sales)
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
= Gross Profit
- Operating Expenses (SG&A, R&D)
= EBIT (Earnings Before Interest & Tax)
- Interest Expense
= EBT (Earnings Before Tax)
- Taxes
= Net Income (Net Profit/Earnings)
```

**Key Metrics**:
- **Gross Profit Margin** = Gross Profit / Revenue
- **Operating Profit Margin** = EBIT / Revenue
- **Net Profit Margin** = Net Income / Revenue

#### 3. Cash Flow Statement
**Purpose**: Tracks actual cash inflows and outflows (reconciles accrual accounting with cash reality)

**Three Categories**:
1. **Operating Cash Flow (CFO)** - Cash from core business operations
   - Net income + Depreciation - Change in working capital
   - Most important for sustainability

2. **Investing Cash Flow (CFI)** - Cash used for investments
   - Purchases/sales of PP&E, acquisitions, securities
   - Usually negative (companies invest in growth)

3. **Financing Cash Flow (CFF)** - Cash from financing activities
   - Debt issuance/repayment, equity issuance, dividends
   - Shows how company raises capital

**Key Insight**: A company can be profitable (positive net income) but have negative cash flow if working capital increases significantly

### Key Financial Ratios

#### Liquidity Ratios (Ability to pay short-term obligations)

**Current Ratio**
- Formula: **Current Assets / Current Liabilities**
- Measures ability to cover short-term debts
- Rule of thumb: > 1.5 is healthy (varies by industry)

**Quick Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)**
- Formula: **(Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities**
- More conservative than current ratio (excludes less liquid inventory)
- Rule of thumb: > 1.0 is healthy

**Cash Ratio**
- Formula: **Cash / Current Liabilities**
- Most conservative liquidity measure
- Shows immediate ability to pay debts

#### Leverage Ratios (Financial structure and solvency)

**Debt-to-Equity Ratio**
- Formula: **Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity**
- Measures financial leverage
- Higher ratio = more debt relative to equity (riskier)

**Debt Ratio**
- Formula: **Total Debt / Total Assets**
- Shows proportion of assets financed by debt
- Alternative: **Equity Ratio = Equity / Total Assets**

**Interest Coverage Ratio**
- Formula: **EBIT / Interest Expense**
- Measures ability to pay interest on debt
- Rule of thumb: > 3 is healthy (company earns 3x its interest obligations)

#### Profitability Ratios

**Return on Assets (ROA)**
- Formula: **Net Income / Total Assets**
- Measures how efficiently company uses assets to generate profit
- Higher is better

**Return on Equity (ROE)**
- Formula: **Net Income / Shareholders' Equity**
- Measures return to shareholders
- Higher is better (but check if driven by excessive leverage)
- **DuPont Identity**: ROE = (Net Income/Sales) × (Sales/Assets) × (Assets/Equity)
  - Breaks ROE into: Profit Margin × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier

#### Efficiency Ratios (Asset utilization)

**Asset Turnover**
- Formula: **Sales / Total Assets**
- Measures how efficiently company generates revenue from assets
- Higher is better

**Inventory Turnover**
- Formula: **COGS / Average Inventory**
- Measures how quickly inventory is sold
- Higher turnover = faster inventory movement (usually good)

**Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)**
- Formula: **(Accounts Receivable / Sales) × 365**
- Average days to collect payment from customers
- Lower is better (faster collection)

**Accounts Payable Days**
- Formula: **(Accounts Payable / COGS) × 365**
- Average days company takes to pay suppliers
- Higher = company retains cash longer (but not too high)

---

### Working Capital Management

**Net Working Capital**
- Formula: **Current Assets - Current Liabilities**
- Measures short-term financial health
- Positive NWC = company can cover short-term obligations

**Cash Conversion Cycle**
- Formula: **DSO + Days Inventory Outstanding - Accounts Payable Days**
- Time from paying suppliers to collecting from customers
- Shorter cycle = better cash management

---

### Key Concepts

**Financial Leverage**
- Using debt to amplify returns to equity holders
- Works well when ROA > interest rate on debt
- Risk: Magnifies losses during downturns

**Operating Leverage**
- High fixed costs relative to variable costs
- Higher operating leverage = more sensitive to revenue changes
- Example: Airlines (high fixed costs) vs consulting (low fixed costs)

**EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation & Amortization)**
- Formula: **EBIT + Depreciation + Amortization**
- Proxy for operating cash flow (excludes non-cash charges)
- Useful for comparing companies with different capital structures

**Free Cash Flow (FCF)**
- Formula: **Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures**
- Cash available after maintaining/growing asset base
- Key metric for valuation (what's available for investors)

---

### Common Adjustments & Considerations

**Non-Cash Charges**
- Depreciation and amortization reduce net income but don't affect cash
- Add back to net income when calculating cash flow

**One-Time Items**
- Restructuring charges, asset write-downs, gains/losses on sales
- Should be excluded when analyzing core operating performance

**Off-Balance Sheet Items**
- Operating leases, special purpose entities
- May not appear on balance sheet but represent real obligations
- Important for complete financial picture

## Examples

### Example 1: Balance Sheet Analysis
**Company ABC Balance Sheet:**
- Total Assets: $500,000
- Current Assets: $200,000
- Current Liabilities: $100,000
- Total Debt: $200,000
- Equity: $300,000

**Analysis:**
- Current Ratio = 200,000 / 100,000 = 2.0 (healthy)
- Debt-to-Equity = 200,000 / 300,000 = 0.67 (moderate leverage)
- Debt Ratio = 200,000 / 500,000 = 40% (40% debt-financed)

### Example 2: Profitability Analysis
**Company XYZ Income Statement:**
- Revenue: $1,000,000
- COGS: $600,000
- Operating Expenses: $200,000
- Interest: $50,000
- Tax (30%): $45,000
- Net Income: $105,000
- Total Assets: $700,000
- Equity: $400,000

**Calculations:**
- Gross Margin = (1,000,000 - 600,000) / 1,000,000 = 40%
- EBIT = 1,000,000 - 600,000 - 200,000 = $200,000
- Operating Margin = 200,000 / 1,000,000 = 20%
- Net Margin = 105,000 / 1,000,000 = 10.5%
- ROA = 105,000 / 700,000 = 15%
- ROE = 105,000 / 400,000 = 26.25%
- Interest Coverage = 200,000 / 50,000 = 4.0 (healthy)

### Example 3: Cash Flow vs Profit
**Company DEF:**
- Net Income: $100,000 (profitable)
- Depreciation: $20,000 (non-cash expense)
- Increase in Accounts Receivable: $50,000 (cash not collected)
- Increase in Inventory: $30,000 (cash tied up)
- Increase in Accounts Payable: $10,000 (delayed payment)

**Operating Cash Flow:**
= Net Income + Depreciation - ΔAR - ΔInventory + ΔAP
= 100,000 + 20,000 - 50,000 - 30,000 + 10,000
= **$50,000**

**Insight**: Company is profitable ($100k net income) but only generated $50k in cash due to working capital increases. This is common in growing companies.

## Study Tips

1. **Understand the relationships**: Balance sheet connects to income statement through retained earnings; both connect to cash flow statement

2. **Memorize key formulas**: Focus on the most common ratios (current ratio, ROE, ROA, debt-to-equity)

3. **Practice numerical examples**: Work through ratio calculations until they're automatic

4. **Context matters**: A "good" ratio varies by industry (tech vs manufacturing vs retail)

5. **Cash is king**: Remember that accounting profit ≠ cash flow. Always consider both.

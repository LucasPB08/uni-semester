Why is $1 today worth more than $1 in the future?	Because you can invest $1 today and earn interest, making it grow to more than $1. This is the core principle of Time Value of Money.
What does the discount factor represent?	The value TODAY of $1 received in the future. It answers: "What is $1 in period t worth right now?"
What is the conceptual difference between compounding and discounting?	Compounding moves money FORWARD in time (PV → FV), while discounting moves money BACKWARD in time (FV → PV). They are inverse operations.
Why is present value always less than the sum of future cash payments?	Because future payments are worth less than the same amount today - we "penalize" each future payment by discounting it. The further away, the bigger the penalty.
What is the key difference between an annuity and a perpetuity?	An annuity pays for a LIMITED number of periods, while a perpetuity pays FOREVER. Both have level (equal) payments each period.
Why is a perpetuity worth more than an annuity with the same payment?	A perpetuity provides infinite payments forever, while an annuity stops after t periods. More payments = more value.
How can you think of an annuity in terms of perpetuities?	An annuity = Perpetuity starting now MINUS Perpetuity starting at year t+1. You subtract the payments you don't receive.
What is the PV formula for a perpetuity?	PV = C / r, where C = payment per period and r = discount rate
What is the PV formula for an annuity?	PV = C × [1/r - 1/(r × (1+r)^t)], where C = payment, r = rate, t = number of periods
What is the FV formula for an annuity?	FV = C × [(1+r)^t - 1] / r
What is the relationship between an annuity's PV and FV?	FV = PV × (1+r)^t. The FV is simply the PV compounded forward t periods.
What's the key difference between nominal and real interest rates?	Nominal rate = dollar growth (includes inflation). Real rate = purchasing power growth (inflation-adjusted). Real rate ≈ Nominal rate - Inflation rate.
When should you use nominal vs real interest rates?	Match nominal cash flows (current dollars) with nominal rates. Match real cash flows (constant/inflation-adjusted dollars) with real rates. NEVER mix them.
What is the difference between APR and EAR?	APR = simple multiplication (rate × periods per year), ignores compounding. EAR = accounts for compound interest within the year, shows true annual return.
Why is EAR always greater than or equal to APR?	Because EAR includes the effect of interest earning interest within the year. More frequent compounding = bigger gap between EAR and APR.
A bank offers 6% APR compounded monthly. Is the true annual return higher or lower than 6%?	Higher. Monthly compounding means interest earns interest 12 times per year, so EAR > APR. (EAR = 6.17%)
What does it mean when we say interest rates "compound"?	Interest earned in one period becomes part of the principal for the next period - you earn interest on your interest, causing exponential growth.
In annuity formulas, why does (1+r)^t appear in the denominator for PV but numerator for FV?	PV formulas discount (move backward) so we divide by growth factor. FV formulas compound (move forward) so we multiply by growth factor.
If inflation is 3% and your investment grows 5% nominally, are you actually richer?	Yes, but only by about 2% (real return). Your purchasing power grew ~2%, even though your dollar amount grew 5%.
What happens to the annuity PV formula as t approaches infinity?	The term 1/(r×(1+r)^t) approaches 0, so the formula simplifies to 1/r - which is the perpetuity formula!
